53293,73471,Patriots Day Is Best When It Digs Past the Heroism,Atlantic,David Sims,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"Patriots Day, Peter Berg’s new thriller that recreates the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the ensuing manhunt that followed it, is a surprisingly oblique, morally ambiguous movie from a typically straightforward filmmaker. Patriots Day takes an unexpectedly cynical view of the chaos, rash   and bureaucratic infighting that followed the bombing —  the question is whether that was Berg’s intended message. For its grim   running time, the movie celebrates the men on the ground who helped bring the bombers to justice, but it’s the glimpses of something more complicated than jingoism that really linger. The scene that best illustrates this dichotomy comes late in Patriots Day. As the search for one of the bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, intensifies, his brother’s wife Katherine (Melissa Benoist) is brought in for interrogation on her connections to the case. As she asks for a lawyer, protesting that she “has rights,” her steely interviewer (Khandi Alexander) tuts, “Honey, you ain’t got shit. ” It’s a Hollywood line intended to provoke a big cheer from the audience, despite its queasy legal undertones. But the film presents it as just that —  a cheesy line. The questioning goes nowhere, and the interrogator exits with a shrug as the movie notes in its   Katherine was never charged with any crime. Patriots Day is filled with this kind of bluster, but the film’s most compelling moments serve to undercut it. Deepwater Horizon Stays Too Close to the Surface, Working against those more interesting themes is the man at the center of the movie, Boston Police Sergeant Tommy Saunders, a fictional character invented to serve as the audience’s eyes and ears at every major turning point of the attacks. He’s played by Mark Wahlberg, the polestar of Berg’s new genre of   storytelling who has played the mouthy heroes at the center of Lone Survivor (2013) Deepwater Horizon (2016) and now Patriots Day. Unlike those other films, Wahlberg’s character in Patriots Day didn’t really exist, and he often comes across as a bundle of screenwriting clichés. He’s nursing a bum knee and was recently demoted due to insubordination, but somehow is on   terms with every cop, uniformed or otherwise, in the city. When the film is focused on Saunders, as it mostly is, it feels like a straight recreation of a traumatic event that occurred less than four years ago. Berg largely does well to avoid sensationalizing the 2013 bombing, which killed 3 and wounded 264 others, and the subsequent manhunt that claimed the life of a police officer. At no point does Patriots Day feel like a glitzy action movie or a gory piece of horror. The violence of that day is not lingered on, outside of an effort to make its victims feel like real people by depicting snippets of their lives beforehand. Wahlberg, for his part, can’t help but make Saunders feel like a bit of a stereotype he’s a     movie cop in a film that’s otherwise seeking nuance. Saunders, it seems, is supposed to stand in for the generally lovable, belligerent Boston spirit that prevailed in the days after the marathon, and Berg drills that point home far too many times. There are bits that work —  in the immediate aftermath of the bombs, Wahlberg successfully communicates how angry and shaken Saunders is, rather than switching into    hero mode. He does a decent job selling the trauma, but once his hefty attitude returns, Patriots Day snaps back to severe unreality. That’s too bad, since the film is most fascinating when it faithfully conveys the confusion of the days after the bombing, and the   of differing opinions and clashing egos. The FBI, led by    agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) takes over the case, recreating the blocks attacked with   bombs inside a gigantic warehouse and combing through surveillance videos for clues. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman) Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach) and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino (Vincent Curatola) gather there to offer their own guidance on the case. Saunders is present too, for some reason, mostly providing expertise on the businesses around Boylston Street. The thorny, mucky,   debates that played out during the manhunt are the best parts of the film. Berg accurately shows DesLauriers agonizing over whether to release the pictures of the Tsarnaev brothers gleaned from surveillance cameras before he’s fully substantiated that they’re the bombers his hand is eventually forced by a leak to the media. That sets into action the series of events that led to a deadly shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers in Watertown (J. K. Simmons plays a police sergeant there). Berg is wise to delve into the utter chaos of that manhunt, which included a brief, informal declaration of martial law and a bizarre, bloody standoff with the brothers that saw them lobbing pipe bombs at cop cars. It’s bedlam, in other words —  total disorder and madness, the kind of violence and fear that terrorism is intended to provoke, even from those trying to stop it. The Boston PD’s efforts to capture the Tsarnaev brothers is justly depicted as heroic, but it’s the crazed   the random chains of events, and the empty, angry posturing that stick out as most worthy of analysis. If Berg had dug deeper, he could have had a great film on his hands as it stands, he’s delivered a rote, but occasionally   misfire."
53294,73472,A Break in the Search for the Origin of Complex Life,Atlantic,Ed Yong,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"In Norse mythology, humans and our world were created by a pantheon of gods who lived in the realm of Asgard. As it turns out, these stories have a grain of truth to them. Thanks to a team of scientists led by Thijs Ettema, Asgard is now also the name of a large clan of microbes. Its members, which are named after Norse gods like Odin, Thor, Loki, and Heimdall, are found all over the world. Many of them are rare and no one has actually seen them under a microscope. But thanks to their DNA, we know they exist. And we know that they are singularly important to us, because they may well be the group from which we evolved. If Ettema is right, then around two billion years ago, an Asgardian microbe (or an incredibly close relative) took part in a unique event that gave rise to the eukaryotes. That’s the group which includes humans, our fellow animals, plants, fungi, and every living thing made from large, complex cells —  all the living things we’re most familiar with, and all the ones we can actually see. Our origins lie either in Asgard, or next door to it.   To understand this story, we have to go back to the very beginning. The Earth was created around 4. 5 billion years ago, and judging by some astonishingly ancient fossils, life emerged relatively soon after. For the longest time, living things belonged to two great domains: the bacteria and the archaea, both microscopic and both comprising single cells. That was the status quo for at least 1. 7 billion years, until the two domains were joined by a third: the eukaryotes. And they were very different. Eukaryotic cells are generally much bigger than either bacteria or archaea. They also have larger genomes. They have internal compartments that act like our organs, each with its own special job. They have an internal skeleton that acts as a transport network for molecules. There’s this huge gulf of complexity that separates them from the other two domains. It’s a gulf that has only ever been crossed once in life’s history. Bacteria and archaea are capable of amazing feats of evolution, but in over 3. 7 billion years of existence, none of them have ever evolved into anything approaching a   cell —  except that one time. Why?   One possible answer, which I’ve written about before, says that eukaryotes were created through an incredibly unlikely merger between members of the other two domains. Somehow, a bacterium found its way inside an archaeon and, rather than being digested or destroyed, became a permanent part of its host. In doing so, it provided the archaeon with an extra source of energy, which allowed it to get bigger, accumulate more genes, and evolve down new paths that were previously inaccessible to it. That fusion cell gave rise to the eukaryotes, and the bacterium eventually turned into the mitochondria —  little   structures that still power eukaryotic cells to this day. Once the eukaryotes evolved, they repeatedly engulf microbes and fused with them —  a process called endosymbiosis. But that’s much easier to do when the host cell is already big, and can engulf smaller neighbors. If the host is an archaeon, the feat becomes much harder and far more improbable. That’s maybe why the merger between an archaeon and a bacterium —  the one that gave rise to mitochondria and may have spawned the eukaryotes —  has only happened once. What were those two ancient partners like? We know that the bacterium belonged to a group called the alphaproteobacteria (which also includes Wolbachia, a microbe that I’ve repeatedly written about here.) But until recently, no one knew anything about the archaeon host.   Ettema changed that in 2015. His team at Uppsala University collected samples of sediment from Loki’s Castle —  a field of hydrothermal vents that lie between Greenland and Norway, at depths of 2, 300 meters. By analyzing the DNA within their sample, the team identified a new archaeon that they called Lokiarchaeota (     ). Their DNA revealed that they are the closest living relatives of all eukaryotes. They’re the best approximations that we have for that ancestral archaeon that gave rise to us all. Loki isn’t alone. Last year, another group led by Brett Baker at the University of Texas in Austin discovered a related group of archaea in the mud of North Carolina’s White Oak River continuing the theme, they called it Thorarchaeota. Now, by teaming up, Ettema, Baker, and others have found even more relatives in sites around the world: Yellowstone National Park, a hot spring in New Zealand,   vents lying near a Japanese island, and many more. “This work is fantastic: going out to the sediments of the planet and digging up the weird and wonderful bugs that live there,” says James McInerney from the University of Manchester. These microbes fall into four major groups: Lokiarchaeota, Thorarchaeota, Odinarchaeota, and Heimdallarchaeota. “There’s around 50 more Asgardian gods, we’re good to go for the next few years,” says Ettema. These four lineages all belong to an overarching supergroup that the team have called Asgard. And we eukaryotes either sit within the Asgardian family tree, or just outside it. We descend directly from either members of the group (perhaps within the Heimdall branch) or from incredibly close relatives. The genomes of the Asgardian microbes hold many surprises. When Ettema looked at their DNA, he was surprised to find genes that are supposedly unique to eukaryotes. Some are for building and remodeling internal skeletons, which archaea don’t have. Others are involved in pinching off bits of the outer membrane to create little pockets that can move molecules around large cells —  and yet, archaea are small. Yet others are typically involved in shuttling molecules between the compartments inside eukaryotic cells —  compartments that typically don’t exist in archaea. When Ettema first found these genes in Loki two years ago, other scientists were skeptical. Perhaps they came from eukaryotes that had contaminated Ettema’s samples. But the presence of such genes in other members of Asgard, collected by different teams from different corners of the world, suggests that they’re real. This doesn’t mean that the Asgardians are eukaryotes themselves, or even anything close. As James McInernery and Mary O’Connell write, “The distribution of genes formerly thought to be   is patchy,” so that no single Asgardian has “a full set. ” Instead, it seems that “the building blocks for those   traits were most likely already present in our archaeal ancestors,” says Ettema. This feeds into a   and still unsettled debate about the origin of eukaryotes. Some scientists believe that the bacterium that would become the mitochondria was swallowed by a host cell that was already big, complex, and most of the way to becoming a eukaryote. Others hold that the host was still a true archaeon, and that it was the merger that allowed it to become more complex. On the face of it, the presence of   genes in Asgard supports the former idea. But Ettema disagrees. Based on their genomes, “they’re not very sophisticated cells, but they have many of the right components in place,” he says. “They were primed to become eukaryotes. ” This debate is likely to rage on for a while, because no one has actually seen the Asgardians themselves. In the 1980s, scientists developed ways of identifying microbes by searching for their DNA amid environmental samples. This is now the main way of finding new species, but it means that many microbes —  like Loki and its kin —  are only known through their DNA. No one knows what they look like. “It’s high on our priority list,” says Ettema. “It’s crucial that we have a look at the cells to see what they’re doing, but that’s extremely hard. Loki was discovered in   ocean sediments, where you don’t go every day. Thor and Heimdall are present in shallower environments, but they’re less than 0. 1 percent of the total microbial community. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack, but we’re working on it. ”"
53295,73474,Obama’s Ingenious Mention of Atticus Finch,Atlantic,Spencer Kornhaber,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"“If our democracy is to work in this increasingly diverse nation,” Barack Obama said in his farewell address last night, “each one of us must try to heed the advice of one of the great characters in American fiction, Atticus Finch. ” He then quoted Finch: “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . .. until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” Chelsea Clinton’s Apt Wrinkle in Time   In the moment, it occurred to some viewers that Finch also provided   quotes on diversity. Like, “Have you ever considered that you can’t have a set of backward people living among people advanced in one civilization and have a social Arcadia?” Like, “Do you want Negroes by the carload in our schools and churches and theaters?” Like, “The Negroes down here are still in their childhood as a people. ” The vision of Atticus Finch that Obama referenced was the upstanding one that Americans have idolized for decades, naming their sons and bars and   companies after him. That Finch is the lawyer and father of Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, who in the 1930s South defended a black man wrongly accused of rape and generally stood as a beacon of decency and tolerance. But Finch all along has been a more complicated figure than many recognize, with one line of academic inquiry arguing him as a paternalistic figure. Seeming to confirm that reading, in 2015 Finch’s reputation took a hit with the publication of Go Set a Watchman, a newly unearthed manuscript by Lee telling of Mockingbird’s characters 20 years after that novel’s events. It wasn’t a sequel but rather a draft set apparently in a different reality, with details contradicting those of Mockingbird. And in it, an adult Scout Finch returns to Maycomb County, Alabama, to find her father, now 72, has become an outspoken racist. The novel follows her struggle to reconcile what she had seen in childhood with what had become of her dad and her hometown, where the civil rights movement had inflamed white hatred. It’s unlikely that Obama, or at least his speechwriters, didn’t know about these   complications for Atticus Finch. But it is possible they calculated that for most Americans, the enduring image of Finch is the one set by To Kill a Mockingbird in 1960, not the one from Go Set a Watchman. It’s also possible some more nuanced signaling was going on —  a call for understanding with Trump supporters, and a call for the renewal of battered American ideals. The Finch quote came during a portion of Obama’s speech devoted to how racial tension poses a threat to democracy. While many of his remarks addressed the white majority that elected Donald Trump, he also asked Americans who’ve been discriminated against to show some empathy toward many of their antagonists. “Blacks and other minorities” should be “tying our own struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face,” he said, including that of “the   white man who from the outside may seem like he’s got all the advantages, but who’s seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and technological change. ” That admonition is much the kind of rhetoric that has often frustrated Obama’s liberal critics who say that he’s been too evenhanded, too willing to engage in false equivalencies, to fully call out American racism. His speech took at least one shot at those critics: “I’ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10, or 20, or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say. ” By invoking Finch in the same section where he asked for empathy toward resentful white men, he is doubling down: For America to overcome the prejudices of people as bitter as the Watchman version of Finch, those people need to be understood. Whether you agree with that thought or not, it’s a clever use of literary reference to push back at Obama’s critics to the left who’ve read his focus on incrementalism and individual change as capitulation. Many of those critics might have written off Finch even   Obama might have countered them by saying, not for the first time in his public life, that each person’s empathy matters even in the face of an unjust system. More than anything, though, the invocation of a flawed American icon’s enduring,   bit of wisdom underlines what Obama’s message was throughout the speech. Go Set a Watchman told of a time of supposed progress —  desegregation —  that was met with furious, disheartening backlash. Obama’s words last night would have offered Scout comfort in the 1950s just as they offered comfort for his supporters in January 2017: “For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back.  But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some. ” Obama was not necessarily denying the troubling person Atticus Finch may have become, just as he was not denying the country’s troubling situation now. But he was calling on America to ensure that the best version of itself, and the best versions of its heroes, remerges."
53296,73475,"Donald Trump Meets, and Assails, the Press",Atlantic,David A. Graham,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"Updated on January 11 at 5:05 p. m. In his first press conference since July 2016,   Donald Trump took only a few questions but made news on several fronts, saying he accepted the conclusion that Russia conducted hacks on top Democrats, bashing the press, and refusing once again to release his tax returns. Trump also refused to answer questions about whether any of his aides had been in contact with Russian officials, though he later said they had not as he departed the press conference. During the press conference, Trump announced a plan he said would answer concerns about conflicts of interest between the government and his business interests, yielding the stage to an attorney to explain the arrangement. The   was in combative mode, scolding reporters and the intelligence community and dodging several questions. He was asked early on about a pair of stories that emerged Tuesday night —  one, from CNN, saying that he had been briefed on a memo that said Russia agents claimed to have compromising information on him, and a second, from BuzzFeed, that posted a dubious dossier of allegations. He blasted the publication of that dossier, and thanked news organizations that had not run it. “I read what was released, and I think it was a disgrace,” Trump said. He would not comment on whether he had been briefed on the material, saying briefings were classified, but he said the allegations contained in the memo and dossier were untrue. But Trump said for the first time that he believed the Kremlin had conducted the hacks against the Democratic National Committee and others, but he downplayed that particular action as just one of many. “As far as hacking I think it was Russia, but I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people,” he said. (He later added, in response to a separate question, that it “could’ve been others also. ”) Trump offered an ambiguous read on the publication of private material, on the one hand blasting the leak of the dossier to the press —  an action that he pinned, without proof and probably incorrectly, on the intelligence community —  while at the same time suggesting that the hacking of the DNC was bad but somewhat mitigated because of the information it revealed. The   refused to answer questions about whether any of his aides had been in contact with Russian officials, as some reports have stated. In an extremely tense exchange, he dismissed dogged questioning from CNN’s Jim Acosta, saying, “You are fake news. ” As he left the press conference, however, he answered another reporter who reprised the question, saying, “No. ” Trump insisted, despite copious reporting to the contrary as well as his own son’s statements, that he did not and never had business dealings in Russia. When a reporter asked him whether he would release his taxes to prove that, he once again demurred, claiming they are under audit. (He has not proved that claim, and the IRS says there’s nothing to prevent him from releasing taxes that are under audit.) Yet he also seemed to suggest that having won the election, he no longer had any incentive to release the returns. “The only ones that care about my tax returns are the reporters,” he said. “I mean, I won! I became president!” (A recent Pew poll found that 60 percent of Americans would like Trump to make the documents public.) The details of Trump’s plan to solve his conflicts of interest remain to be explored and parsed, though he made several peculiar comments during the press conference. He asserted, dubiously, that he has very little debt. He claimed to have been offered a $2 billion deal in Dubai over the weekend, but he said he’d turned it down —  even though, he said, he had no obligation to do so. “I could actually run my business and run the government at the same time,” Trump said. He added, “I have a   situation because I’m president. ” That’s an outrageous statement. While not all    laws apply to the president, the lack of legal constraints does not mean conflicts of interest cannot exist. Moreover, Trump is still subject to the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, among other rules. Before taking questions, Trump boasted about companies opening new factories in the U. S. or canceling planned offshoring. Although he claimed credit, most of those decisions were made prior to his election. “I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created, and I mean that,” he said. And Trump promised to continue to throw his weight around. He thanked states that had voted for him on Election Day and seemed to suggest that those states would be rewarded. He attacked pharmaceutical companies for charging high prices, and said the federal government should bargain with them. Current federal law bars such negotiation for Medicare. While Democrats have long lobbied for greater bargaining power, pushing this argument could put the   into conflict with Republicans in Congress, who have opposed bargaining. Yet as much as the event was a chance for the press to address Trump, it was also a forum for Trump to address —  and dress down —  the press. The first speaker was incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who called the publication of the dossier “frankly shameful and disgraceful. ” Next up was Mike Pence, who scolded reporters that “with freedom comes responsibility. ” When Trump himself arrived at the lectern, he, too, attacked reporters. “It’s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a nearly daily basis,” Trump said. “We stopped having them because we were getting a lot inaccurate news. ” He also thanked news organizations that had not published the dossier. “I have great respect for the news, and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that,” Trump insisted."
53297,73476,Trump: ’I Think’ Hacking Was Russian,Atlantic,Kaveh Waddell,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"Updated at 12:25 p. m. After months of equivocating on the origin of cyberattacks that targeted Democrats before the election,   Donald Trump said Wednesday that he thinks Russia was behind the intrusions. “As for hacking, I think it was Russian,” Trump said at a press conference in New York. “But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. ” Later, he emphasized his skepticism. “It could’ve been others also,” he said. At a meeting on Friday, the   was briefed on classified intelligence by the heads of the NSA, FBI, and CIA, as well as the Director of National Intelligence. They presented a report that concluded, with high confidence, that the Russian government directed the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats like Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta. The investigation also found that that the Russian campaign, ordered by President Vladimir Putin, was engineered to help get Trump elected. A brief, unclassified summary of the agencies’ findings was made public last week. Trump said he expects hacking will subside once he takes office. “Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I’m leading it than when other people are leading it. You will see that,” he said. “[Putin] shouldn’t have done it. I don’t believe he’ll do it anymore. ” After touching on Russia’s cyberattacks, the   brought up the data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management in 2014 and 2015, which were linked to the Chinese government. He says the   hacking has been blown out of proportion, and that other governments are also involved in  . (One key difference: Information stolen in the OPM data breach has not been made public, while Russian agents leaked sensitive communications between Democrats to WikiLeaks and other mouthpieces for publication.) Trump blamed the Democratic National Committee for its lax cybersecurity, and praised its Republican counterpart for its network protection. He claimed that hackers were “unable to break through” the Republican National Committee’s defenses —  but the FBI says Russian hackers were in fact able to penetrate some “old” computer systems that were “no longer in use. ” Asked if the Russia’s hacking campaign was justified, Trump deflected the question. He said that he has “no dealings” with Russia which would leave him vulnerable to being influenced, but declined again to release his tax records to back up his claim."
53298,73477,Seth Meyers Questions Kellyanne Conway (and the Politics of Late-Night),Atlantic,Megan Garber,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"Here was one of the first questions that Seth Meyers,   comedian, posed to Kellyanne Conway, pollster and counselor to the president, when she appeared on his show on Tuesday evening: CNN has a report that the intelligence community briefed both the president and the   with allegations that the Russian government has compromising information on   Trump —  both business information and personal information. I know this just happened. Can you confirm or comment on the fact that the intelligence community has presented this? The question may have come from a comedian. Its recipient may have been clad in sequins and seated in a plush easy chair. The duo’s exchange might have taken place amid all the glinty aesthetics of   comedy. Still: Squint, and it looked an awful lot like journalism. It wasn’t just Meyers’s request that Conway “confirm or comment” on the CNN report. It was also his deflections of Conway’s own attempts to deflect his queries. It was his question, in response to Conway’s assertion that “nobody has proven” that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, “But shouldn’t we care if the Russians tried to interfere, whether it affected the outcome of the election or not?” And it was his response, when Conway told him that Trump “has said that he is not aware of that” —  the “that” in this case meaning, ostensibly, the briefings that were the subject of the CNN report —  that the  ’s lack of awareness “concerns me. ” It was his further response, when Conway met Meyers’s note about Trump’s apparent lack of curiosity in determining the extent of the Russian involvement in the election with “he was curious enough to figure out America”: “That’s a pivot right there, Kellyanne. ” (He added: “And, by the way, no one does it better. ”) That the pair’s exchange would be contentious was, on the one hand, entirely unsurprising. Meyers, first of all, has made no secret of his (progressive) partisanship. His audience was clearly on his side in the engagement. And the questions he asked Conway took on the specificity they did in part because of the interview’s timing: The news of Trump’s being briefed about the compromising information, first reported by CNN, broke right before Late Night taped. But Meyers also took the stance he did because of the changes that have come to   comedy in recent years —  and, especially, within the most recent one.   may once have offered an easy way for politicians to connect with people and humanize themselves in the eyes of public, via sax performances, charming discussions of pets, and the like occasionally, it still does that. As the lines between “politics” and “everything else” have faded, though, even the   couch has doubled, ever more, as a hot seat. Trevor Noah grilled the conservative pundit Tomi Lahren when she appeared on his show late last year. Samantha Bee interviewed Obama. The bookers for The Late Show With Stephen Colbert saw to it that the very first episode of their new series would feature, as Colbert’s guest,   frontrunner Jeb Bush. That Meyers would end up asking a guest to “confirm or comment” on “allegations” provided by the intelligence community was in that sense not a moment of deviation from the norms of   comedy it was a perfect example of them. And Meyers himself has also gone out of his way to emphasize the civic responsibilities of   comedy. As he put it during his show’s monologue the day after the 2016 presidential election, “Donald Trump made a lot of promises as to what he was going to do over the next four years, and now we get to see if he will, if he can, fulfill them. So I’d just like to make one promise to him: We here at Late Night will be watching you. ” Conway is not Trump she is, however, a close adviser to him. And she is, furthermore, (in) famously skilled at the Sun       arts of rhetorical deflection and political spin. Softballs, because of all that —  the traditional stuff of the prior age of   banter —  simply wouldn’t have been appropriate for Meyers’s interview. And while she has been an omnipresence on cable TV —  a fact that was mocked recently, and delightfully, by Meyers’s former employer —  she has not been a mainstay of the   circuit. How Comedians Became Public Intellectuals, All of which added up to this: On Tuesday, Meyers’s viewers —  and the many, many people who watched his interview of Conway after the fact, via Twitter and YouTube and media summaries like this one —  watched an interview that might as well have taken place on cable news. An interview that attempted to hold Conway —  and, by extension, her boss —  to account. They were watching, at the same time, one more example of journalism’s expansion into the world of entertainment. And of entertainment’s expansion into journalism. They are movements that have been, in many ways, inevitable. Journalism, in the U. S. is messy by design. There are no professional guilds, as in law and medicine, that regulate who may, and may not, engage in its practice. There are only a lot of voices —  ever more voices —  joined by a very loose set of goals and aspirations: that facts matter. That ideas do, too. And that —  a less widely shared aspiration, but an animating one nonetheless —  democracy demands groups of people who are willing to speak truth to power, whoever, and however, they may be. Increasingly, those people are entertainers. Comedians are serving, more and more, as political activists.   comedy is becoming, more and more, a place of earnest —  and informed —  political debate. The lines between journalism and other ways of understanding the world —  between media as information and media as entertainment —  are vanishing. Whether  that will prove to be a beneficial development for American democracy, or the opposite, remains to be seen. But it is, in general, the new state of affairs. So much so that a presidential adviser could settle down into an easy chair and be asked not to share a lighthearted anecdote, but to respond to a CNN report. So much so, as well, that her host, when she tried to deflect his questions, would make a point of calling out her attempts at spin. “I’m very excited about this,” Meyers told Conway, during the Late Night interview that helped to erase those lines. He added: “And, obviously, I think a lot of the questions I’m asking you will be asked to the   tomorrow. ” The event taking place “tomorrow”? A press conference.  "
53299,73478,Obama Frames His Economic Legacy,Atlantic,Gillian B. White,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"In Barack Obama’s final speech as president, he touted nearly a decade of economic improvement. “If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history  …     you might have said our sights were set a little too high,” he said to great applause. But despite his cheery retrospective, the outgoing president also had words of warning, particularly about the important link between the country’s political stability and its economic health. A polarized country, he suggested, is the fastest route to economic ruin. Likewise, a dysfunctional economy will produce political polarization. They are inseparable. Looking at where the economy stood when Obama took office in January of 2009, it’s impossible to deny the progress that has been made. “Today, the economy is growing again wages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are rising again poverty is falling again. The wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records. The unemployment rate is near a   low,” Obama said. While many would dispute whether the tax code is indeed ”fairer,” the fact that the 44th president entered office during one of the worst recessions in recent memory and leaves an economy significantly stronger than he found it is a point of fact. As my colleague Bourree Lam wrote, the final jobs report of the Obama presidency showed that he presided over 75 months of consecutive job growth, a feat surpassing many of his predecessors —  though one that was partly enabled because the job loss sustained during the early years of his administration was so staggering. At the end of his term, the unemployment rate will hover below 5 percent —  half of where it was at the nadir of the recession. And while there’s been much debate about the quality of the jobs added, and criticism of the decreasing   participation rate, in the last year of Obama’s presidency the economy showed a   sign of strength: wage growth. But despite these gains, the economy still shows signs of weakness. And in his farewell speech Obama addressed the fact that many   and   Americans continue to struggle with underemployment, insufficient wages, and higher costs of living, even as a small portion of wealthy Americans grow richer. This uneven progress isn’t just frustrating, it’s a threat to the basic tenets of fairness and possibility that fuel faith in the country, he suggested. “Our democracy won’t work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity,” Obama said, touching on inequality and social mobility, two issues that have been referenced again and again during his administration. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, one couldn’t help but remember that this growing inequality was a focus of both parties during the election. The GOP blamed it on Obama and democratic policies, a position that seems to have brought to the polls a very specific base of   white voters, frustrated by job loss and limited economic mobility. Obama spoke to this dynamic, if somewhat indirectly, “While the top one percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many families, in inner cities and rural counties, have been left behind —  the   factory worker the waitress and health care worker who struggle to pay the bills —  convinced that the game is fixed against them, that their government only serves the interests of the powerful —  a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics,” he said. In these statements, Obama attempted to bridge the gap between Americans who share the burden of economic suffering but remain divided within the electorate by region, race, occupation, and political affiliation. But more than a salve between the groups, Obama’s statements also contained a warning for those wooed by Trump’s promises to bring back jobs in middle America and the Rust Belt —  those who feel that they would still be thriving economically if not for Democratic policies. “The next wave of economic dislocation won’t come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good,   jobs obsolete,” he said. His prescription for this future threat stands in direct opposition to Trump’s platform of locking out foreign workers, closing borders, and lowering both individual and corporate tax rates: “We must forge a new social compact —  to guarantee all our kids the education they need to give workers the power to unionize for better wages to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now and make more reforms to the tax code so corporations and individuals who reap the most from the new economy don’t avoid their obligations to the country that’s made their success possible. ” Obama, predictably, ended on an optimistic note, asking Americans to be vigilant but not afraid, and to find more common ground than reason for division. The economy, he reminded, doesn’t have to be a   game."
53300,73479,The Trump Administration’s Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet,Atlantic,Jeremy Venook,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"With confirmation hearings beginning, attention is shifting slightly away from Trump and toward those who may make up his administration. Like the   under whom they may soon be serving, many of Trump’s nominees have been pulled from the upper echelons of the business community or are otherwise political outsiders. Also like Trump, many of them have come under significant scrutiny for how their pasts may lead to conflicts of interest with the roles they are nominated to serve. These are especially noteworthy because, unlike during the transitions to previous administrations, it appears that this year’s confirmation hearings will begin before the Office of Government Ethics has had adequate time to perform background checks. This highly unusual turn of events goes against the explicit objection of the Director of the OGE, who wrote in a letter to the Senate’s Democratic leadership that he is “not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate has held a confirmation hearing before the nominee has completed the ethics review” and warned, “For as long as I am Director, OGE’s staff and agency ethics officials will not succumb to pressure to cut corners and ignore conflicts of interest. ” (Also of note is a letter from current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who in 2008 sent   Majority Leader Harry Reid a letter detailing his expectations for thorough ethical clearance but is now questioning the motives of those calling for the same for Trump’s nominees.) Moreover, in contrast with the rules for the president, there are both explicit rules regarding conflicts of interest for appointed officials and a long history of appointed officials abusing their offices for personal financial gain. With regard to the former, the law “prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests” or those of his family members, a general partner, or any organization with whom he or she “serves as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, or employee” or may one day be employed. Violations could result in jail time of up to five years, a fine of up to $50, 000, or both investigations into alleged misconduct fall under the purview of the Justice Department. For the latter, perhaps the most infamous example of   officeholders acting in their personal financial interests is the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s, in which Warren G. Harding’s Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall was convicted of accepting bribes in administering the leases for oil reserves in Wyoming and California. The administration of Ulysses S. Grant, meanwhile, was plagued by scandals in seven federal departments, ranging from gold speculation in the State Department to bribery for postal contracts, to the Whiskey Ring scandal, which led to the resignation of Grant’s Supervisor of Internal Revenue and his personal secretary. In recent decades, more than 100 of Ronald Reagan’s appointees, including Attorney General Edwin Meese and Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver, were investigated for financial impropriety, leading to numerous firings and resignations. During the Obama administration, opponents accused Steven Spinner, who served in multiple   roles in the Department of Energy, of inappropriately pushing for a $535 million loan guarantee for the solar company Solyndra while his wife worked at a law firm representing the company. Even more recently, allegations of conflicts of interest were arguably central to the 2016 presidential campaign, in which Trump repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton of inappropriately commingling her office as Secretary of State with her family’s foundation. Adding to all of these concerns is the fact that Trump’s family members appear likely to have a larger role in his administration than a president’s family has had in any administration since John F. Kennedy’s appointment of his brother as Attorney General led to the creation of     laws. Ivanka Trump, for example, is poised to take on many of the duties typically expected of a First Lady, and has sat in on at least one of her father’s meeting with a    her adult siblings, Donald Jr. and Eric, are members of their father’s transition team and often seen as among his closest confidants, although it remains unclear what, if any, official roles they will take on in his administration. And Trump’s    Jared Kushner, whom many expect will be one of the  ’s top advisers once he takes office, has   and publishing interests of his own that could intersect with his official duties. As my colleague Olga Khazan noted, the question with conflicts of interest is not if, but when and how much they will affect behavior. Research into doctors who receive gifts from drug companies —  often as apparently meaningless as a pen or clipboard —  shows that “even small kickbacks can change   individuals’ behavior” by subtly changing how a doctor perceives the company behind the gift. As such, The Atlantic will be expanding our coverage of Trump’s conflicts of interests to include those expected to serve in his administration. Below is the current list of Trump’s prospective administration members, official and otherwise, whose actions or financial entanglements have prompted concerns over conflicts of interest. Because the law requires most aspirants for   positions to resolve such questions before entering office, some have already taken the steps necessary to mitigate conflicts of interest these steps will be noted as applicable. The most recent updates appear at the top: Trump’s Family Members, Though Trump has not —  in fact, cannot —  appointed any members of his direct family to a post in his administration, it nevertheless appears that they will likely have significant input in his administration. According to numerous sources, Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka, is likely to take on a policy portfolio roughly on par with that of a typical first lady just what it will comprise is not yet known, although based on meetings she has taken since the election with Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore, climate change has arisen as a possibility. Meanwhile, according to NBC, her husband, Jared Kushner, will be serving as a senior adviser to the president. And though Trump’s adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, apparently will not be serving in any official capacity within their father’s administration, they are nonetheless widely seen as among his closest confidants and are members of his transition team. Already, Trump’s three aforementioned children’s proximity to the   has created significant conflicts of interest. (Trump’s other adult child, Tiffany, does not appear likely to be part of the administration.) Much of this revolves around their father’s professed commitment to resolving issues with his namesake corporation by putting his assets into a trust that will be managed by Donald Jr. and Eric. As I have previously written, though Trump and his supporters have referred to the plan he has described as a blind trust (or, more recently, a “  trust,” which is a thing that doesn’t exist) the children’s   role as advisers to their father means they don’t have nearly enough separation to maintain a true blind trust. (And since so much of Trump’s business derives from real estate and his personal brand, even a real blind trust would not be sufficient to allay concerns about conflicts of interest, as he will retain his knowledge of what those assets are). Additionally, since Trump’s election, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric have all been photographed in meetings that compromise even the illusion of distance from their father’s political dealings. All three appeared in photos of a summit between their father and the leaders of numerous technology companies, as well as a meeting with the   and his Indian business partners. Ivanka and her husband sat in on a meeting between their father and the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, even though Ivanka was at the time negotiating a branding deal with a company owned in part by the Japanese government. Donald Jr. and Eric, who the   has decided will run the business in his stead, have both attended meetings on their father’s behalf. Along with the    problems, all three have drawn criticism for allegedly selling access to the administration through their companies or charitable foundations. After Ivanka appeared on 60 Minutes, her company sent out an advertisement for the $10, 000 bracelet that she wore on air. On December 6, the Eric Trump Foundation initiated an online auction for a chance to have a meeting over coffee with Ivanka as criticism mounted, the foundation removed the web page, though not before the bidding reached more than $70, 000. And both Eric and Donald Jr. were involved in a planned, but ultimately cancelled, charity fundraiser scheduled for the day after their father takes office whose attendees could pay up to $1 million for a private reception with the   as well as a hunting trip with one of his two sons. In the aftermath, Trump announced that Eric would be closing down his foundation to prevent further speculation. Meanwhile, Jared Kushner’s business entanglements also create conflicts with his expected role in the Trump administration. First and foremost, some ethics experts believe that his involvement will trip federal   laws that have been in place since after John F. Kennedy named his brother Robert to the post of attorney general, although Trump’s and Kushner’s lawyers have concluded otherwise. On January 7, just two days before Trump’s transition team confirmed that Kushner would officially be taking a position, The New York Times reported that he has been pursuing a deal with the Chinese financial giant Anbang Insurance to redevelop 666 Fifth Avenue, a centerpiece of his   holdings. Kushner’s brother, Josh Kushner, is a   of the healthcare startup Oscar, which could stand to make millions off of the potential restructuring of the insurance market should Trump pursue repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. According to The New York Times, Kushner’s lawyer has said that he is taking several steps to mitigate conflicts of interest. These include getting rid of his common stocks and his stake in the New York Observer, selling many of his assets to his brother, creating a family trust to be controlled by his mother, and resigning from his role as chief executive of Kushner Companies. Though Kushner is so far taking more active steps than his    has, problems remain. As is the case with Trump’s proposed trust, having a family member administer a trust does not create nearly enough separation to make it truly blind. Moreover, like the  ’s business, many of Kushner’s assets are   simply handing over their operations doesn’t override Kushner’s existing knowledge of what will affect their value, even if he says he will recuse himself from decisions that may affect them. In other words, as with his    conflicts of interest will remain unless Kushner takes more complete steps to distance himself from sources of income that could influence his   in the White House.  Back to table of contents, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, After weeks of speculation and apparent interest in several more conventional possibilities, Trump eventually settled on Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, as his nominee for Secretary of State. Though Tillerson, who has a net worth in the hundreds of millions, is actually among the less wealthy of Trump’s nominees, his position as head of the world’s largest publicly traded international    company has led to questions as to whether he will be able to fully divorce his business interests from his official duties. As is the case with the   he is expected to serve, much of the consternation over Tillerson relates to his apparently unusually copacetic relationship with Vladimir Putin. In fact, according to Steven Coll’s book on the company, Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power, the relationship, which culminated in Tillerson receiving an award called “the Russian Order of Friendship” from Putin, was a key reason Tillerson was chosen as the company’s CEO in 2006. Alexey Pushkov, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russian parliament, weighed in on Tillerson’s nomination on Twitter shortly after it was announced, calling the nomination “a sensation. ” Along with his ties to Putin, Tillerson’s nomination has raised concerns because of Exxon’s complicated relationship with the U. S. government. According to the Financial Times, while Tillerson was in charge of the company, Exxon signed multiple deals with the Russian   oil company Rosneft —  whose chief, Igor Sechin, is considered a member of Putin’s inner circle —  to develop resources in the Black Sea, Siberia, and the Arctic Circle. These developments ceased, however, when the United States sanctioned the Russian oil industry in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014. As could be expected for a person in his position, Tillerson was an active opponent of the U. S.’s sanctions throughout the process after all, the sanctions have prevented Exxon from moving forward with deals reported to be worth billions of dollars. That Tillerson has publicly questioned the utility of sanctions —  and has made at least five visits to the White House since Obama authorized the sanctions —  is in a sense inextricable from his role with Exxon. As Secretary of State, he will have significant sway over those sanctions, which means that he could plausibly pursue a policy that would make his former company billions. So far, Tillerson has taken a number of steps to comply with    rules. According to CNN, Tillerson will be selling off his more than 600, 000 shares in Exxon —  currently valued at more than $54 million —  before taking office. In addition, rather than paying Tillerson his expected retirement package (2 million Exxon shares, valued at more than $181 million, over the next decade) the company will put the value of the retirement package into a blind trust that will not be allowed to invest in the oil company. And should Tillerson return to work in the    industry in the next 10 years, he would forfeit the entire sum. He is also expected to recuse himself from any issue that may affect his former company for his first two years in office. Tillerson’s divestment offers something of a model for future appointees as well as potentially for Trump himself. Though Tillerson, like Trump, has yet to respond to pressure to release his tax returns, he has created an arrangement by which his previous entanglements are sufficiently remote that he can reasonably say they no longer pose a conflict of interest.  Back to table of contents, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Wilbur Ross, Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Commerce, is one of several wealthy businesspeople in Trump’s proposed cabinet. Ross, who Trump called “a champion of American manufacturing” and “one of the greatest negotiators I have met,” is a billionaire investor who made much of his fortune by buying and reselling distressed companies, including those in the steel, coal, and textile industries. Along the way, Ross had a record of outsourcing jobs and slashing benefits for workers at the companies that he took over, as well as for a 2006 explosion at a mine operated by a company he owned. Ross’s financial holdings also create significant conflicts of interest that he will have to navigate before he assumes office. For example, Ross has a stake in, and sits on the board of, ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producer, a company that frequently has a major stake in the Commerce Department’s regulation of the steel industry, including its monitoring of exports, imports, and tariffs. In fact, according to ProPublica, during the first 100 days of Trump’s administration, the Commerce Department is likely to be ruling on investigations into unfair pricing of steel imports from Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy, all of which could significantly affect ArcelorMittal’s profits and stock prices. Ross is also a vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, where he served alongside Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch who Putin recently placed in charge of a major initiative to bring   jobs to Russia and who was once accused of hiring gunmen to take control of a Siberian oil field. Though Ross has stated that he intends to step down from his position, his namesake   firm, WL Ross  Co. will retain its stake in the institution. Beyond the specific entanglements involving ArcelorMittal, Ross’s job as Secretary of Commerce would give him opportunities to advance his general interests in the steel industry: Unless he not only steps down from his position at ArcelorMittal but also sells his stake in the company, Ross will be profiting off of any decision by his own department that makes the company more money. As was noted during the campaign after it was reported that Trump used Chinese steel in some of his development projects, the Department of Commerce recently began a probe into the   Chinese steel industry’s avoidance of American tariffs and use of a “dumping” strategy, in which the Chinese companies undermine the American industry by flooding the market with their product at an artificially low price. As Trump’s commerce secretary, Ross would be in charge of continuing the probe and developing a strategy moving forward, which could be done in a way that makes his own holdings more valuable. So far, representatives of Trump and Ross have dismissed these concerns by comparing Ross’s situation to that of Penny Pritzker, the billionaire businesswoman who has served in the role under President Obama since 2013. In order to comply with the Office of Government Ethics’    rules, Pritzker sold off her stake in more than 200 companies and resigned from her position with Hyatt Ross could conceivably do the same and put his resulting assets in a blind trust. Until he does so, his billions in holdings and industry involvement could influence, or at the very least be seen as influencing, his   in office.  Back to table of contents, Secretary of Labor Andy Puzder, Andy Puzder, Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Labor, is one of Trump’s many nominees with a history of antagonism toward the very body he will soon be leading. As the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which owns the   chains Carl’s Jr. and Hardees, Puzder developed a long track record of opposition to   and overtime rules and   policies he also characterized the department’s policies under President Obama and current leader Tom Perez as “deterrence by ‘gotcha’ enforcement. ” Along with his antipathy toward the department, Puzder would bring to the position significant financial entanglements that could threaten his ability to discharge his duties in office. Among the Department of Labor’s duties is investigating claims of     violations and occupational safety hazards.   chains are frequent targets of such claims during Puzder’s tenure at CKE, the Labor Department investigated allegations of wage theft and other problems at several Hardee’s franchises, finding violations in nearly 60% of cases. Complicating matters is the fact that such actions typically target the individual franchisees rather than parent companies like CKE. According to Bloomberg, of the 108 investigations into   stores since 2004, only six were at   restaurants, none of which yielded a fineable violation. When Puzder first emerged as a possible candidate for the position, a source close to him suggested that, since 94 percent of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurants are franchises not directly operated by CKE, Puzder may not have to recuse himself from his company in order to carry out his duties as Secretary of Labor. However, as is true for the   himself, simply being uninvolved in the    operation of a profitable enterprise does not resolve conflicts of interest. The problem is not Puzder’s level of control over CKE and its individual franchises but the fact that he makes money off of a company that frequently comes into conflict with the very department that he will soon be heading, which could create perverse incentives to pursue policies against the interests of the company’s employees or the general public. As such, it remains an open question how Puzder will distance himself from CKE to avoid the possibility that his role with the company will interfere with his potential role in the Trump administration.

53301,73484,The Longstanding Crisis Facing Tribal Schools,Atlantic,Alia Wong,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Havasu Canyon is home to turquoise waterfalls, billowing cottonwood trees, and red sandstone cliffs that attract thousands of tourists each year. It’s also home to the Havasupai people, a federally recognized Native American tribe allegedly subject to education conditions so dreadful it’s as if many of the reservation’s children don’t attend school at all. That’s according to a lawsuit filed in Arizona’s U. S. District Court on Thursday, which accuses the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) —  the federal agency responsible for funding and overseeing tribal schools —  of repeatedly failing to improve the learning environment at Havasupai Elementary School. Despite federal obligations to offer a diverse curriculum that incorporates the Havasupai culture and language, the suit contends, the school doesn’t even teach subjects beyond reading and math. Extracurricular activities are nonexistent, as are   services —  even though roughly half of the school’s 70 students have special needs. Students are repeatedly suspended or referred to law enforcement, with one of the plaintiffs attending class for just 20 percent of the school year when he was 8 years old. The school is so understaffed, according to the suit, that the school janitor occasionally fills in as a teacher. Sometimes it allegedly shuts down entirely. The Subtle Evolution of Native American Education, “The conditions at the Havasupai School deny to these students fundamental access to education that children across the country simply take for granted,” said Kathryn Eidmann, a staff attorney at the pro bono law firm Public Counsel and one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, during a phone call with reporters. “This institutional disregard communicates an unmistakable message: that the government believes these children are disposable, that their education is a responsibility that the government would rather wash its hands of. ” Students at Havasupai Elementary performed at the first percentile in reading and the third percentile in math, according to   federal data cited in the complaint, meaning it placed last among the BIE’s 183 schools. It’s unclear whether the allegations will be substantiated. Both Jeff Williamson, the principal of Havasupai Elementary and a defendant in the case, and a spokeswoman for the BIE, which falls under the U. S. Department of the Interior, declined to comment. Still, the lawsuit is likely to bring greater attention to problems that have dogged BIE schools across the country for decades —  challenges the Obama administration has sought, but struggled, to address. Arne Duncan, the former U. S. education secretary, once described the BIE as “the epitome of broken” and “utterly bankrupt. ” Even the secretary of the interior, Sally Jewell, has acknowledged the bureau’s shortcomings, calling Indian education “an embarrassment. ” In demanding that the BIE commit to providing a quality education to all its students, the case, according to Eidmann, wouldn’t only be “a potential prototype for BIE schools all across the country” —  it would also establish “a precedent that applies to students in every BIE school. ”   Federal law requires that the BIE provide education at least as good as that offered to   students, but it’s   that that’s rarely the case. Graduation rates on reservations are among the lowest of all student subgroups —  the graduation rate for Native American students broadly is just 69 percent. At BIE schools, it’s 53 percent. Eight in 10 Native students are not proficient in reading, according to 2007 federal data cited in the complaint, and children at BIE schools perform significantly worse than their Native peers at regular public schools. “These issues that the children and the community of the Havasupai face are endemic to the BIE,” Alexis DeLaCruz, a staff attorney at the Native American Disability Law Center and one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said during the call. While the vast majority of Native American students attend traditional public schools, the BIE serves nearly 50, 000 children. The BIE published a “Blueprint for Reform” in 2014, but change has been slow. The alleged conditions described in the new complaint have long been the norm for the Havasupai community —  and not because no one has pushed the BIE to change things, critics of the bureau say. Don Watahomigie, the chairman of the Havasupai Tribal Council, said on the call that the council has repeatedly approached the BIE to little avail. Laila R. (the suit does not include full last names) whose two sons attended Havasupai Elementary, said during the call that she’s tried for years to improve conditions at the school, writing letters to bureau officials in Washington, D. C. and even suing the agency. “Nothing works,” she said. Her sons fell so far behind, she continued, that she decided to move them out of the reservation.   Instruction aside, the lawsuit, in describing excessive and harsh discipline practices, hints at why so many Native Americans end up in the   system. Frank C. the grandfather of one of the plaintiffs, said on the call that his    grandson, who has special needs, was suspended and prosecuted in federal court simply for pulling wires out of a computer monitor. Children who are disciplined in school are far more likely to end up in prison as adults it goes without saying that being disciplined as a child via formal law enforcement has similarly deleterious, if not worse, effects. The alleged practices at Havasupai Elementary are, the suit contends, characteristic of those at tribal schools across the country. Indeed, a March 2014 U. S. Department of Education report found that Native Americans across the country are disciplined at disproportionate rates. Unsurprisingly, they’re also incarcerated at a rate 38 percent higher than the national average. The Havasupai Reservation lies at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It’s so remote that one can only access it by hiking, or riding a horse, or helicoptering in the village doesn’t have any cars. But its remoteness, Watahomigie said, shouldn’t be “used as a tool by BIE to ignore our educational demands or to turn a blind eye to our needs or to [justify] providing substandard educational services to our people. ”"

Justice Department announced it would investigate the FBI’s and the DoJ’s actions leading up to the presidential election —  in particular, the letter released by FBI Director James Comey on October 28 saying the bureau would renew its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails. That letter, some argue, swayed the election in favor of Trump —  who’s now facing unverified allegations that Russian agents have a compromising video of him. Here’s how that kind of   blackmail works in Russia, and what it could mean for Trump and for America. Meanwhile, the Trump transition continues, with Mike Pompeo, Trump’s nominee for head of the CIA, beginning his first day of confirmation hearings. After Obama:  The Senate voted this morning on a measure that lays the groundwork for repealing Obamacare within the next few weeks. The   law has been Obama’s biggest legislative accomplishment, and a successful repeal by Congress would be a serious blow to his legacy. His influence on the Democratic Party is also in question: In the process of deepening connections with young voters, minorities, and women, he arguably shifted the party’s priorities in a way that alienated older rural voters. That’s just one story of the Obama White House, though. In an appearance last night on The Tonight Show, Michelle Obama demonstrated her own legacy as First Lady —  which, most of all, is one of empathy.

After scientists in China found a gene last year that makes bacteria resistant to even colistin, the drug physicians now use as a last resort, more discoveries followed quickly, and   bacteria are now being found all over the world. On a different, more encouraging note: The discovery of a gene mutation associated with both autism and some cancers has some researchers hoping that cancer drugs can pave the way for autism treatment. J. Weston Phippen on the hermit who inadvertently shaped   science: It was a year into his life alone in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains when Billy Barr began his recordings. It started as a curiosity, a task to busy his mind during the winter. By no means, Barr told me, having skied down from his cabin to use the nearest phone, did he set out to make a vital database for climate change scientists. “Hell no!” he said. “I didn’t know anything about climate change at the time. ” In 1973 Barr had dropped out of college and made his home an abandoned mining shack at the base of Gothic Mountain, a   stone buttress. The cold winds blew through the shack’s wood slat walls as if they didn’t exist. He shared the shack’s bare dirt floor with a skunk and pine marten, his only regular company for much of the year. Barr had moved from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains precisely because of the solitude, but he couldn’t escape boredom. Especially that first winter. So he measured snow levels, animal tracks, and in spring the first jubilant calls of birds returning. He filled a notebook with these observations then another notebook. This has continued now for 44 years. Keep reading here, as Weston tells the story of how Barr’s data found its way into dozens of scientific studies. 1.

Janalynne Rogers —  who “decided to use my full name because there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to having a mental illness” —  recalls her experience with electroconvulsive therapy, commonly called “shock treatment”: There were eight of us scheduled for ECT that morning. The nurses lined up our stretchers in the pink   hallway and systematically administered our sedatives. It was an assembly line of last resort. The fluorescent lights came in and out of focus as I slipped into the   slumber. My next memory is of being thrust back to awareness by the force with which I vomited on the   nurse. I had felt nothing during the procedure and was shipped back to the main hospital while I was still numb. The memories from before, during, and after the treatments are either completely blurred or simply missing. Trying to recall specifics from the rest of my hospital stay is like searching in vain for a simple word that rests on the tip of your tongue but refuses to be said.

53303,73486,A Pledge for More of the Same at the Pentagon,Atlantic,Andrew J. Bacevich,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"That retired General James “Mad Dog” Mattis, Donald Trump’s nominee to become defense secretary, is a Marine’s Marine and a genuine warrior is undoubtedly the case. If less   than David Petraeus, he is easily the better field commander, something Mattis demonstrated in Afghanistan and Iraq. The question is whether he possesses the qualities suited to lead the Pentagon at this particular juncture.   Mattis’s testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which convened today to consider his confirmation, raises doubts on that score. Or more precisely, it should raise doubts on the part of anyone viewing U. S. national security policy since   as less than satisfactory. A Sanctions Skeptic for State? The most intriguing aspect of the exchange between Mattis and members of the committee was the absolute absence of interest, from either side, in how the armed forces of the United States have performed in recent years. In Afghanistan, in the   war in Iraq, in U. S. combat operations, large and small, in Pakistan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, and Syria —  none has yielded anything approximating conclusive victory. However you define U. S. aims and objectives —  promoting stability? Spreading democracy? Reducing the incidence of Islamist terrorism? —  they remain unfulfilled. Yet no senator thought to ask Mattis for his views on why that has been the case, what conclusions he draws from that absence of success, and how he might apply those conclusions as defense secretary. In response to a leading question, Mattis opined that the global order is now being subjected to its “biggest attack since World War II,” with Russia, China, Iran, and terrorism, together, the responsible culprits. Senators neither asked for, nor did Mattis volunteer, any thoughts on whether any correlation might exist between this ostensibly dire situation and the military activism that has been a signature of U. S. national security policy over the past decade or so. First under George W. Bush and then Barack Obama, that penchant for activism has found U. S. forces continuously in combat. How can it be that their many sacrifices and the hundreds of billions of dollars expended have landed the United States in such a precarious predicament? Has America dropped an insufficient number of bombs? Have U. S. troops invaded, occupied, or raided too few countries? None of the lawmakers present —  several of whom made a point of promoting weapons systems produced in their state, or engaged in politically correct posturing —  thought to solicit Mattis’s views on the this gap between effort and outcomes. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut elicited ironclad assurances that Mattis favored modernizing the navy’s submarine fleet, subs being made —  surprise —  in Connecticut. And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York was able to advertise her credentials as a champion of women serving as combat infantrypersons. So of senatorial preening, there was plenty on display. Of questions touching on core issues of national security, there were next to none. The strategic vacuum in which America’s endless wars drag on went unremarked upon. Whether members of the Armed Services Committee are oblivious to the absence of strategy or don’t see such matters falling within their jurisdiction is unclear. Perhaps they just don’t care. As for Mattis himself, he came across as unimaginative and unoriginal. When it came to NATO, for example, he reiterated sentiments expressed by his predecessors of 20 or 30 years ago: history’s greatest alliance, now and forever. Observers worried that the onset of the Trump presidency posed a threat to the status quo can rest easy, at least as far as overseeing the Pentagon is concerned. With Mattis at the helm, the U. S. military apparatus is one swamp that won’t be drained. Indeed, his evident priority is not to drain, but to replenish. Mattis responded to senatorial questioning like the career military officer that he is: by making the case for more. More money for maintaining and refurbishing   equipment, more money to buy new weapons, more money to expand the size of the army, navy, air force, and Marine Corps. New nukes? Yes. New strategic missiles? Yes. A new   manned bomber? Yes. New submarines? Yes. The       ? Love it. Oh, yes, Mattis promised to be a careful steward of the nation’s resources, a vow that senators pretended to take seriously. The various entities comprising the   complex, from General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin, to Boeing and Raytheon, have got to be licking their chops. On multiple occasions, Mattis referred to his determination to enhance the “lethality” of U. S. forces as if an inability to kill people and break things has hampered the effectiveness of U. S. forces. The problem is not a lack of lethality. It’s misguided policies based on a flawed understanding of what armed force can and cannot do, and when it should or should not be employed. On that score, Mattis and members of the Senate Armed Services are certainly on the same page. They are clueless."

In a   vote, the Senate voted 51 to 48 to approve a budget resolution that begins the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act. During his confirmation hearing, Representative Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump’s choice for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said he would “absolutely not” reinstate the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. Under questioning, Ben Carson agreed to set up a system for identifying conflicts of interest between the Trump Organization and housing and urban development projects should he be confirmed as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. And the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to grant retired Marine Corps General James Mattis a waiver from the law that bars recent military retirees from running the Pentagon so that he can serve as Trump’s secretary of defense. U. S. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced that he will investigate allegations of misconduct involving the FBI’s handling of its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server, including director James Comey’s public disclosure related to Clinton’s emails 11 days before the election. And President Obama honored Vice President Joe Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Manhandling the Media: “America’s political press corps is feeling anxious, territorial, threatened,” writes McKay Coppins. And Trump showed Wednesday, during his first news conference in months, that he is prepared to take advantage of this weakened state by pitting reporters against each other. A ‘  Shop’: Richard Spencer, “one of the   leaders of the white nationalist movement that has adopted the name ‘’” had a rough few months following some unflattering press. Now, he hopes to start fresh by setting up a “hub” for his group in northern Virginia.

53305,73488,The Contradictions of Ben Carson’s Vision for American Housing,Atlantic,Alana Semuels,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"When he was on the campaign trail, Ben Carson spoke frequently about the inefficiency of government, and expressed skepticism about particular government programs. “We have 4. 1 million federal employees, and we have 645 government agencies and  . And there’s an enormous amount of inefficiency and overlap to be gotten rid of,” he told Marketplace’s Kai Ryssdal in November 2015. He also expressed special disdain for an   rule, released in the summer of 2015, that required local communities to assess segregation in their communities and try to address it. “Based on the history of failed socialist experiments in this country, entrusting the government to get it right can prove downright dangerous,” he wrote about the rule in the Washington Times. All of this made many housing advocates nervous when Donald J. Trump announced that Carson was his pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which spends much of its energies on providing housing and subsidies for the poor. How would an agency with a $47 billion budget fare under someone who thought government spending should be cut, and that efforts to end segregation —  a core HUD mission —  are akin to “failed socialist experiments”? His Senate confirmation hearing did little to answer these questions, as Carson both pledged to cut spending, and to keep —  or even expand —  programs that are the hallmark of what HUD does. “I do believe that government can play a very important role,” he said, in his opening statement. “There are points of intervention, things we can do to make a difference in people’s lives. ” What he doesn’t believe, it seems, is that the government should spend money to carry out those interventions. When New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez asked Carson whether his “worldview” fit into HUD’s core mission, Carson defended his campaign pledges to cut back on government spending. “We can never seem to cut, because people have their programs and they say, ‘This one is sacred, and this one is not.’ The point being, if we can find a number on which we can agree and begin to cut back, we can start thinking about fiscal responsibility,” Carson said. “Bear in mind, we are approaching a $20 trillion national debt. ” Carson also believes that there should be a limit to how much public assistance America should provide. “We have to be cognizant of our fiscal responsibilities, as well as our social responsibilities,” he said in response to a question by Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. “Would we love to put every single person in a beautiful unit forever? Absolutely, that would be ideal. But we don’t necessarily have the necessary funding. ” And in an exchange with the Republican senator from North Carolina Thom Tillis, Carson pledged to look at which HUD programs he could cut: Tillis: What’s the best thing we can do for people with government assistance? Carson: Get them off of it. Tillis: Do you think there are any sacred cows in HUD that stand in the way of that outcome? Carson: I’ve been studying it carefully and I haven’t seen one yet. Tillis: Do you think that to a certain extent over the years we’ve gone from providing housing to providing warehousing for an unacceptable number of people who are supported through the federal government? Carson: Well, the key to your question there was the word “unacceptable. ” And yes, absolutely. Tillis: Do you believe that HUD and the other agencies have creeped their scopes over time and that you can be someone who may say that HUD needs to be smaller, or some other organization needs to be smaller so that the people best able to provide the safety net, the agency best positioned to provide the safety net can do it, and you can complement in some points and take the lead in others? Carson: I believe we need to be much more efficient. Yet when various senators asked Carson to weigh in on specific programs that helped their constituents, he consistently pledged to keep them going. That included a   demonstration that provides assistance to 4. 5 million households, a   block grant that will provide $1. 6 billion to Americans, including thousands affected by floods in Louisiana, and a program to rid housing of lead hazards. In fact, he said, a program to end veteran homelessness “needs more enhancements. ” He also promised to embark on a nationwide “listening tour” to hear more about what needs to be improved at the department. And, despite his own repeated statements to cut down on expenses, he pledged, to the Democrat senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, that he would advocate for a budget for HUD. “I want to put together a   plan on housing in this country,” Carson said. “And then I want to come to you with that   plan. And I want to convince you all that this is what we need to do. I don’t know what that number is going to be —  it might be more, it might be less. ” Carson also seems to be of two minds about the government’s role in eradicating segregation. For all his criticisms of government policies meant to reduce segregation, when asked by Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio about the   rule to affirmatively further fair housing, Carson said he didn’t have a problem with affirmative action or integration. “I do have a problem with people on high dictating it when they don’t know anything about what’s going on in the area,” he said. “What I believe to be the case is that we have people sitting around in desks in Washington, D. C. deciding on how things should be done. ” But the pivot from   rhetoric to policy setting is always complicated when one of those desks is now yours."
53306,73489,A Sanctions Skeptic for State?,Atlantic,Siddhartha Mahanta,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump’s choice to serve as secretary of state, fielded roughly nine hours of questions before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. Among other things, he was asked for his views on the role of economic sanctions in foreign policy, whether fossil fuels contribute to climate change, and how a Trump administration will deal with the extrajudicial war on drugs in the Philippines. Tillerson, who served for 10 years as the CEO of the oil giant ExxonMobil, often sounded like the engineer he was earlier in his career, replying frequently that he would need more time to gather facts —  for example stating that he did not have “sufficient information” to say whether Russia’s action in Syria constituted war crimes. A Brief Guide to Rex Tillerson’s Controversial Foreign Ties, Yet he also expressed some clear views, which were heavily scrutinized given their how they aligned with ExxonMobil’s interests. A case in point was the use of sanctions, which he referenced in his opening statement, along with aid, as an instrument of foreign policy to be used “when appropriate. ” On multiple previous occasions, Tillerson has expressed opposition to the Obama administration’s   sanctions against Russia, where ExxonMobil has substantial business ties. During the hearing, Tillerson explained his skepticism: “[B]y their design [sanctions] are going to harm American business. That’s the idea, to disrupt America’s business engagement in whatever country is being targeted for sanctions. ” Still, he expressed openness to using narrow sanctions for specific problems, for example if the United States was under direct cyberattack by a foreign country. “[If] the conclusion is made that these sanctions are going to be the best and most appropriate way to act,” he said, “then I think the executive would like to have the optionality to make that decision. ” New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, a key architect of U. S. sanctions against Iran and Russia, at one point stated that sanctions are intended to disrupt economies abroad, rather than harm business at home. But Tillerson’s view finds support within the business community —  Myron Brilliant, the U. S. Chamber of Commerce’s executive vice president and head of International Affairs, for instance, wrote in an email that “American workers and farmers shouldn’t have to take a hit for a policy that has no chance of succeeding. ” U. S. sanctions against another country could, for example, limit its citizens’ ability to purchase American goods, or spark an equivalent response by the targeted country against the United States. When Menendez told Tillerson during the hearing that “diplomacy is not the same as deal making,” he underscored both the tension between Tillerson’s former role and his potential future one, as well as the exact reason sanctions matter. They move the terrain of conflict from into the economic realm, where the American casualties might be shareholders or even jobs, but are not U. S. soldiers. “While I appreciate that Mr. Tillerson did not advocate for the immediate repeal of sanctions currently in place, he was noncommittal on maintaining or increasing sanctions on Russia,” New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen said in an  . “His stance on sanctions is something I think many members of the committee will be reviewing when deciding their vote. ” Several senators, including Oregon’s Jeff Merkley, also questioned Tillerson about the involvement of a European ExxonMobil subsidiary with Iran, Syria, and Sudan, countries which the U. S. has sanctioned for terrorism sponsorship. Merkley wanted to know whether Tillerson recalled any discussions over whether ExxonMobil should have disclosed these deals Tillerson claimed he could not. But Merkley seemed focused not so much on haranguing Tillerson over past behavior, but on assessing whether, as secretary of state, he would discourage a CEO from taking actions that undermine U. S. efforts to combat terrorism. “I would certainly be open to having the folks in the State Department contact companies and just inquire as to whether they’re aware of the actions they’re taking,” Tillerson replied. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy went further. “[W]as there any country in the world whose record of civil rights was so horrible or whose conduct was so directly a threat to global security or U. S. national security interests that Exxon wouldn’t do business with it?” Tillerson replied: “The standard that is applied is first was it legal, does it violate any of the laws of the United States to conduct business with that particular country, then beyond that it goes to the question of the country itself: Do they honor contract sanctity? Do they have a rule of law? And if they do or don’t, are there mitigating actions that can be put in place to protect whatever business activity might be undertaken?” Murphy pointed out that Tillerson’s list did not include a country’s human rights record or the national security interests of the United States. “That   …     could go to contract sanctity, rule of law, and stability of the country, which is always a judgment as well,” Tillerson said. This is what some senators of both parties and public interest groups seem to be worried about: the possibility that Tillerson, should he become secretary of state might not be able to divest himself —  spiritually, if not materially —  from his more than four decades at a company that’s done business everywhere, from Russia to Chad to Indonesia. In his responses regarding ExxonMobil’s activities, Tillerson displayed a clear, technocratic preference for the rule of law: in essence, that if a certain business decision was legal and profitable, then it was prudent. But what some of the questions directed at Tillerson implied is that national interests do not always align with private interests, and, in fact, that they often shouldn’t. “Tillerson’s performance yesterday confirmed our concern that he is not prepared to make the switch from advancing Exxon’s interests to serving the interests of the American people,” Zorka Milin, senior legal adviser at Global Witness, wrote in an  .  Tillerson also showed some surprising differences between Trump’s views and his own, most notably regarding Russia, about which he said he had not spoken to Trump. He labeled Russia’s annexation of Crimea as illegal, and said that the United States should have provided more aid to Ukraine. He also affirmed his support for NATO. Ties between Trump and the government of Petro Poroshenko, the president of Ukraine, meanwhile, are strained, stemming from the  ’s openness to warmer ties with Russia. Trump has also suggested that, to maintain U. S. support, the alliance’s other members should spend more on their militaries, and that it should focus more on terrorism, a stance less welcome by the governments of Germany and France. In an exchange with the Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Tillerson also said it was fair to assume that Putin knew of any cyberattacks against the United States Trump himself was reluctant to embrace reports of Russian involvement until his press conference yesterday. Given ExxonMobil’s longstanding business ties with Russia and Tillerson’s personal relationship with Putin and Igor Sechin, the CEO of the   oil firm Rosneft, this was notable. Tillerson has set in motion a recusal process to avoid conflicts of interest with his former employer, which is more than Trump, his potential future boss, has promised. At his press conference yesterday, he announced a plan to transfer control of his company to his sons, an approach that fails to meet the standards set by many ethics experts to avoid conflicts of interest. But Tillerson’s recusal may sunset in only a year or two, while his term, if confirmed, could extend beyond that timeframe. There remains the question of how well Tillerson can adjust his approach to the world, with its complex system of sovereign governments, treaties, and interests that may not necessarily align with those of a massive corporation like ExxonMobil. The task for him will be to prove that he can, as he said he knows he must, leave the business of oil behind, in favor of the business of state."
53307,73490,Baltimore Police Agree to Stop Abusing Their Power,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"The U. S. Department of Justice and the city of Baltimore announced an agreement to reform the city’s troubled police department on Thursday. The   document lays out a detailed plan for the Baltimore police to try to correct egregious violations of constitutional rights, racial disparities in their practices, excessive use of force, and a culture of retaliation against whistleblowers. The agreement could represent one of the last hurrahs for the   movement before the Trump administration takes office. The agreement, which the city voted to fund Thursday morning, even before it had been made public, resolves a federal investigation that began with the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in April 2015. That death provoked widespread demonstrations in the streets of the Charm City, and some rioting, drawing the spotlight to a long history of racial division and unequal policing in Baltimore. While a prosecutor’s bid to convict officers for their role in Gray’s death failed, the Justice Department produced a   report last August. The Horror of the Baltimore Police Department  The report found, for example, that Baltimore police tended to make frequent stops and arrests, even when there was no useful   reason for it, and often at the expense of community relations. But the problem ran much deeper: Police often made stops and arrests that fell afoul of constitutional protections. Many stops ended with no citation or arrest, and even when they did, booking officers often rejected charges as too flimsy —  doing so 11, 000 times between 2010 and 2015. Sometimes cops rounded up large numbers of people, then “unarrested” them when they determined they had no grounds for it. Justice also found that people were often arrested simply for exercising their First Amendment rights by criticizing or talking back to officers. But those most likely to be arrested were disproportionately African Americans and people in heavily African American neighborhoods. Blacks were more likely to be arrested for minor, apparently pretextual violations like throwing dice —  for which 99 percent of arrestees were black. The problem was so bad that boilerplate language provided to officers for logging arrests assumed by default that suspects would be black males. African Americans were also more likely to be exposed to excessive use of force. Police were routinely mishandling cases with mentally disabled suspects, and they belittled or pressured victims of sexual assault. And when some officers tried to speak up, they were subject to reprisals from fellow officers. DOJ surmised that the numbers it received from BPD probably underestimated the problem, since there appeared to be many encounters that were not property logged. The agreement reached Thursday is 50 percent again as long as the initial report, and offers a series of detailed prescriptions intended to solve the problems that report had documented. Although “the City and BPD did not and do not admit or agree with the findings in the United States’ Report,” it says, they “recognized that the United States’ findings raised issues of importance to the City, BPD, and the community that should be addressed, and they committed to address each of the concerns raised. ” Many of the clauses in the report are fairly standard —  like a commitment to better training, or homage to the importance of   policing, today’s big buzzword in   reform. But others are more specific. “BPD will ensure that it conducts all Investigatory Stops, Searches, and Arrests in accordance with the rights secured or protected by the Constitution, and state and federal law,” the agreement states. Officers will have to tell individuals stopped for voluntary interviews that providing ID is optional, and refusing to cooperate will not justify detention, arrest, search, or issuing a ticket. People who run from the police cannot be stopped or arrested simply for that fact, as Freddie Gray was. Moreover, an officer must have “specific and articulable facts, that a person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime” in order to detain them or conduct an investigatory stop. Police will have to document each of these stops, and they will not be allowed to use boilerplate language. An individual’s presence in a location, such as an area police deem to be high in crime or proximity to a crime, will not be enough to justify a stop or detention. Except in certain circumstances, police will also have to seek a superviser’s permission before arresting people for a range of crimes that might actually represent pretextual stops, including obstructing, hindering or resisting an officer disorderly conduct gambling failure to obey an officer or making a false statement to an officer and misdemeanor trespassing. Whenever police arrest someone but let them go without charging them, whether for lack of probable cause, an identity issue, or other reasons, the department will have to report that to monitors. Police face new restrictions on unholstering their service guns. They will be prohibited “from exhibiting or pointing a firearm unless the officer reasonably believes that the situation may escalate to create an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or another person. ” There are new guidelines for dealing with people in   crises. The procedure for dealing with victims of sexual assault is being overhauled. One set of new rules focuses on the central question in Gray’s death and the trial of officers. Gray was apparently healthy when he was arrested and placed in a police wagon, but by the time he was removed less than an hour later, his spinal cord was nearly severed. He died after a week in a coma. But the question of how Gray had been injured was never resolved. Contrary to department regulations, he was not seatbelted in, though officers said that was common. Reform advocates, and prosecutors, suggested that Gray had received a “rough ride” in the back of the van, a practice in which police drive erratically so as to bang a prisoner around. But they couldn’t prove that in court. New regulations are designed to avoid that sort of problem. Officers will be required to seatbelt prisoners in, and vans will be equipped with cameras to track what’s going on in the back. It is not a coincidence that the agreement between Baltimore and the Justice Department arrives in the final 10 days of the Obama administration. DOJ consent decrees have proven to be one of the most common, and most consistently effective, tools for forcing police departments to reform themselves and end abuses, particularly with regards to unfair police practices toward African Americans. (That is not to say that such consent decrees are a silver bullet: The Cleveland Police Department was under one in the   emerged from it, and then was placed under another in 2015.) In December, The Washington Post reported that the Justice Department was rushing to finish a consent decree with Baltimore and another with Chicago, another police department with a troubled relationship with African American citizens. The Trump Justice Department is not expected to be nearly as active as the Justice Department under Obama Attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. In his prepared remarks before a confirmation hearing this week, Attorney   Jeff Sessions complained that “law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the actions of a few bad actors and for allegations about police that were not true. ” Last fall’s Justice Department report on Baltimore, as well as its earlier report on Ferguson, Missouri, show just how appalling and systemic the flaws in police departments can be. But starting on January 20, the push to fix those problems will no longer be able to rely so heavily on the investigative and punitive muscle of the federal government."
53308,73491,About That Young Pope,Atlantic,Sophie Gilbert,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Imagine, if you can, that an unlikely outsider ascends to one of the highest offices in the world, benefited by the machinations of a group of schemers who assume he’ll be easy to control, and will rely on their wisdom to govern. But the new leader is, it turns out, completely unfit for office: petulant, greedy, and with a yen for publicly humiliating people. Thanks to an unhappy childhood, he’s a bottomless pit of emotional need, and those surrounding him are suddenly forced to confront the awful reality of their choice, and how acutely it threatens the foundations of a major global power. That’s about the gist of The Young Pope, HBO’s surreal, striking new series starring Jude Law as a   archbishop from New York who becomes, much to the surprise of a billion congregants, the leader of the Catholic church. Paolo Sorrentino, the Italian filmmaker who wrote and directed the   series, saturates scenes with the trappings of religiosity, but his real object of fascination seems to be power: how it’s achieved, how it’s abused, and how it corrupts. There’s little plot development beyond that, at least in the first five episodes made available to critics, and a good degree of cinematic   meaning The Young Pope is frequently tedious in a very dazzling way. But it’s also an extraordinary portrait of the kind of loneliness and neediness that sparks in some men an almost psychopathic quest to dominate others, and of the enablers who convince themselves that their work is God’s plan. Taboo: A Grim, Gruesome Costume Drama Starring Tom Hardy, The mood is set in the baffling opening sequence, which sees the new Pope crawl out from under a vast pile of   babies, dress himself, and deliver his first ever homily in St. Peter’s Square, in which he urges the assembled audience to play, to masturbate, to get abortions, and to celebrate gay marriages. It’s a dream sequence, and a feint: As emerges over the course of the first two episodes, the Pope is a regressive conservative who wants to take the church backwards, not forwards. Although he sips Cherry Coke Zero, wears Havaianas, and cites Salinger and Banksy as inspirations, in his thinking and mission he’s indubitably less modern. Before he was Pope Pius XIII, he was Lenny Belardo, an orphan abandoned by hippie parents and raised by Sister Mary (Diane Keaton) a nun who becomes his political adviser in the Vatican. He has leapfrogged his mentor, Cardinal Michael Spencer (James Cromwell) who was thought to be next in line for the papacy. Some of the show’s most fascinating moments come in the pope’s scenes with Spencer and Sister Mary, since he can’t quite muster the authoritarian sneer he uses elsewhere with the two people —  neat parental   —  who essentially raised him. Now ensconced in Rome, Pius wastes no time in dismantling any illusions that he’ll be a telegenic   easy to handle and placate. He toys with Cardinal Angelo Voiello (Silvio Orlando) the Camerlengo and Secretary of State, in their first meeting, ordering the cardinal to fetch him a cup of coffee personally. He refuses to pose for any photographs, and delivers his first public address shrouded in darkness, furiously condemning churchgoers for forgetting God. “I have nothing to say to those who have even the slightest doubt about God,” he rages. “All I can do is remind them of my scorn and their wretchedness. ” When a kid shines a laser pointer in his direction, he storms off the balcony, ranting, “I don’t know if you deserve me. ” There are obvious questions prompted by all this that Sorrentino declines to answer, namely whether such a monster could realistically conquer the Vatican while being seemingly devoid of charm, political savvy, and possibly even faith. The new pope often seems excessively villainous Law employs hammy levels of superciliousness, peering down his nose at anyone in his presence, smiling coldly, and affecting an unblinking, withering stare. He issues whimsical orders (a kangaroo sent over as a gift by the government of Australia is released into the Vatican gardens, as bizarre and out of place as Pius himself). He sets up his own spy network, coercing the priest who hears the cardinals’ confessions into relaying the information to him. And he surrounds himself with loyalists, casting out those who displease him (in one case literally, all the way to Alaska). The main narrative thrust of the first few episodes is whether Voiello will succeed in orchestrating the pope’s downfall, but it’s padded out with far too many scenes of Pius being, to put it bluntly, a total dick. (“I know I’m incredibly handsome, but please, let’s try to forget about that,” he tells the prime minister of Greenland.) Far more compelling is his personal history, which is fleetingly alluded to in dreams, his cavernous insecurity, and his inscrutable faith. Because his parents rejected him, Spencer tells him, “you want to make the world pay for the wrong it did. ” With his abrupt   and sweeping shots, Sorrentino gives the show a heightened sense of the bizarre (in one scene, Voiello blackmails a cardinal while clutching a stuffed toy deer). The Young Pope considers themes he’s explored in many of his previous films: power and corruption in Il Divo, loneliness and isolation in The Consequences of Love, the human capacity for monstrousness in This Must Be the Place, his first film made in English. But it’s buffeted by the pomp and ceremony of the Vatican, with many scenes as richly detailed as Renaissance paintings. When Sorrentino contrasts this familiar visual opulence with modern life (as the opening credits do, pairing Jimi Hendrix and neon lights with portraits of saints and visions) the show feels at its most striking. But its pacing frequently sags, with the series’s   running time perhaps excessive for an auteur more used to handling projects within much tighter frames. The Young Pope, a   between HBO, the British network Sky Atlantic, and the French network Canal+ kicks off a year in which we’re sure to see more meticulous examinations of political order being upended, following a series of extraordinary election results and a surge of populism. In that context, Sorrentino’s show is an intriguing mix of high and low art, combining the ambition and scale of a fiendishly expensive HBO drama with both the palette of an auteur and strong elements of trash. It’s a strange, often perplexing work, but it’s hard to think of a more timely portrait of an institution so disrupted."
53309,73492,The DeVos Hearings: A Crib Sheet,Atlantic,Emily DeRuy,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"The Trump administration could bring to the fore some education terms that have been largely overlooked in recent years as it moves to dramatically change the way students learn in the United States. And officials and advocacy groups will throw around other words that are commonly heard but not always thoroughly understood. As Congress prepares to decide whether   Donald Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is fit for the job, it’s worth reviewing what some of the words and phrases that will be floating around in the coming days and months actually mean: School choice: Trump and DeVos have repeatedly said they are fans of school choice. It’s a phrase that backers of charter schools (see that definition below) often use to avoid the more contentious “charter” wording. Broadly, proponents of school choice say they want students to be able to attend whatever school they and their families decide is best, whether it’s the traditional public school down the street or a charter across town. Sometimes, people also argue that school choice means parents should be able to use taxpayer dollars to send their kids to private schools, too. Vouchers: About that public money to pay for private school   …     That’s where vouchers come in. Vouchers, which Trump and DeVos have both backed and which are opposed by many Democrats, let families use government money to pay for private schools, including, sometimes, religious schools. The Trump administration has talked about creating a national voucher program, which would be unprecedented, but it already exists in various forms in several states. Understanding the variety is important. Some voucher programs are very limited —  like the one in Arkansas, which is restricted to students with disabilities. The state lets families with   children use public money to pay for private school, but it requires those schools to be accredited and to administer certain tests. Indiana, where Vice   Mike Pence is from, has a broader voucher system that lets   students (in addition to students with disabilities) use public money to pay for private schools. Voucher amounts vary and the way they are distributed isn’t uniform. Proponents say vouchers create a competitive environment that allows students to get the best education possible the idea is that poorly performing schools will work to improve the education they deliver to avoid losing students and the funding they come with. But opponents say vouchers pull money away from public schools without reducing costs, and that students from families who do not take advantage of vouchers could suffer as their peers depart for private schools. Opponents also raise concerns about vouchers funding religious education, which is something DeVos supports. Education Savings Accounts: Commonly referred to as ESAs, education savings accounts give families state money to spend as they see fit (within parameters, which vary by state). Unlike vouchers, which are specifically to pay for private or parochial school, these accounts let parents pay for private school, as well as things like tutoring or transportation to and from school. Like vouchers, some states restrict access to certain students, such as children with disabilities or Native American students who live on reservations. The way states distribute the money varies, with some giving families their allotment (how they calculate that allotment also varies) upfront and others doling it out in pieces. As with vouchers, proponents argue the accounts increase competition and, subsequently, the quality of offerings, while opponents voice concerns about whether families are using the money wisely. Attempts to expand them have generated considerable controversy, perhaps most publicly in Nevada. Charter Schools: This term has obviously been on the public’s radar for some time now, but it’s worth pinning down. To start, charter schools are public schools (which is why they are often contrasted with “traditional” public schools): They are   and they do not charge tuition. But they are privately managed, meaning they are not overseen by local districts (although some are authorized by those districts). Some charter managers are nonprofit and some are  . Sometimes charter schools are part of a larger chain (think Success Academy or KIPP) and sometimes they stand alone. When the charter concept was developed in the early ‘90s, the broad idea was to give the schools more flexibility than traditional public schools —  so that they might incubate innovative education ideas —  while still requiring them to meet certain standards and accept all types of students, often through a lottery system if there are more interested kids than spots. (There is much debate about whether and which charters successfully meet this mission.) While there is some partisan debate around charter schools, the divide isn’t as simple as Republicans in favor, Democrats against. While Republicans do generally support charter schools, so do a number of Democrats, including the outgoing education secretary, John King, who helped found a charter. But the model has been opposed by Democratic teachers’ unions, which argue that charters pull funds from the traditional public schools the unions represent. Magnet Schools: Magnet schools are public schools operated by traditional school districts. But they are different than the average neighborhood school in that they offer specialized content. For instance, a school might specialize in math and science, the performing arts, or languages, meaning it would offer different curriculum than other schools in the district. The schools are open to all students in a district instead of just kids who live nearby. Like charters, they are free and often rely on a lottery system to admit students. But unlike charters or private schools, they generally have to follow the same rules and requirements as other schools in the district. Many magnet programs were created as an attempt to combat school segregation, the idea being that students from all over a district would gather under one roof with a common interest. And districts frequently turn failing schools into magnet programs to try to turn things around (with varying levels of success). Trump has supported the magnet concept in campaign speeches as part of his broader   push. Public schools: At the most basic level, public schools are schools that are not private. (Yes, obviously, but bear with me.) This term is often used, especially when it’s politically expedient, to refer to schools that are not charter schools or magnet schools, but that’s not technically accurate as noted earlier, charters and magnets are public, too. Most often, when people say “public school” they mean “traditional public school,” meaning a local neighborhood school that is funded by taxpayers and attended (for free and without a lottery system) by the children who live nearby. The vast majority of American children attend a traditional public school."
53310,73493,Donald Trump Says ’96 Million’ Are Looking for Work,Atlantic,Derek Thompson,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Donald Trump’s first press conference as   will be   for his jeering at the press and vague dismissals of financial and ethical impropriety. But buried inside the taunting and dissembling was a Trump moment that stands out as a kind of microcosmic footnote —  subtle yet representative of his ability to scramble the news cycle with simple falsehoods. “Right now, there are 96 million [people] wanting a job and they can’t get [one],” he said. “You know that story. The real number. That’s the real number.” No. That’s not “the real number. ” This is a perfect example of the effect Trump will have on any policy debate he seizes. He takes a fraught yet critical topic —  American work, lack of the work, and the way the U. S. government addresses both —  reduces it to a bizarro sound bite that bears no relationship to reality, and bends the political and policy conversation toward his dramatic warping of the truth, all without offering a substantive plan to address even the moderate version of his apocalyptic proclamations. Trump didn’t pull this particular figure out of thin air. There are 96 million Americans over the age of 16 who are not in the labor force. But “not in the labor force” does not mean they want a job and can’t get one. In fact, it means something quite different: that they are neither working nor looking for work. To use this number as a data point about unemployment is absurd. Most of these 96 million people are retired. Most of the rest are    parents and students. To say that 96 million people “want a job and can’t get one” is to argue that a    grandfather at a nursing home is struggling to find a suitable job. Is Trump hoping grandpa gets back on his feet and starts realizing his latent labor potential? If not, don’t call him unemployed! If yes, we have deeper issues. I don’t want to give the impression that unemployment is a    issue just because Trump’s mistake is   . As CNBC’s Steve Liesman wrote, the real number is closer to the 5. 4 million Americans who say they want a job but aren’t working. Liesman is technically right. That is the official figure. But determining the “real” unemployment rate is not like measuring the pressure of a gas in a beaker. It’s a measurement inflected with mutable values and arbitrary definitions. Imagine a home with one working parent, one    parent, and three children between the age of 16 and 21 who are busy attending school. According to Trump, the unemployment rate of this household is 80 percent. According to the government, by contrast, the unemployment rate of the household is zero percent. But there are plenty of people think that’s not quite right either. What if the    parent is a father who used to work at an auto factory that was shut down and he only decided to stay home with the kids after unsuccessfully looking for work for 12 months? In this case, he was considered “unemployed” for 12 months. When he stopped looking for work, he fell out of the labor force, which means the government stopped counting him as “unemployed,” even though he’s just as jobless as he was before. Unemployment is supposed to measure slack —  the difference between Americans’ ambition and capacity to work and the work they actually do. Because measuring what people want is always complicated, the government has several ways to measure the unemployment rate. A    would prefer to work but he’s taken early retirement and only checks job listings once a year or so. Is he “unemployed”? It’s is a tough question, and reasonable people could disagree. A    spends all month studying for her AP finals. Is she “jobless but looking for work”? No, and it’s not very close. Trump’s gaslighting of the unemployment rate isn’t just an epistemological quandary. The president elect has made it this far by   the scale of America’s problems while   a reasonable plan to fix them. He lambasts   as   hell holes for black Americans without bothering to consider the root causes of poverty, racial prejudice, and gun violence. He incites Rust Belt voters to furious resentfulness without a broader plan to help millions of displaced workers adjust to shocks from globalization and technology. He claims that middle America is beset by unemployment and precarity, while the cornerstone of his economic policy is a    tax cut aimed at the richest Americans and corporations, combined with the repeal of a health care law that insures millions of people who belong to that very precariat. That’s why this is about more than an unemployment statistic. A free press will be constantly challenged in a political environment where the most powerful individual is indifferent to the provenance of information and disdainful of the very instinct to investigate the veracity of his statements. A press conference is often an opportunity for journalists to catch a politician in a lie under the lights and cameras. But this is Trump. The lights and cameras signal a theatrical performance in which he, the star, can make up whatever lines he wants without shame or accountability. So, the real work must happen   in the slow, messy, and uncelebrated process of separating truth from fiction, even in a country where legacy news companies have lost control over the dissemination of information to audiences, and the president himself is indifferent to evidence. And yet, on “the 96 million” and so much else, there is immense value is pointing out again and again that the president elect is simply wrong, wrong, wrong, even if there is no expectation that Trump himself will ever admit it."
53311,73494,A ‘One-Stop Shop’ for the Alt-Right ,Atlantic,Rosie Gray,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Richard Spencer, one of the   leaders of the white nationalist movement that has adopted the name “” has —  by his standards —  been laying relatively low lately. Spencer’s never shied away from the media, but an outbreak of Nazi salutes caught on video by The Atlantic at his organization’s conference in November caused an overwhelming uproar, making Spencer a target within his own movement and threatening his carefully cultivated image as the  ’s approachable face. Add to that a planned   march against Jews in Spencer’s town of Whitefish, Montana, stemming from his feud with a local woman whom he accused of harassing his mother, a dilletantish   trial balloon, and getting banned from Twitter for a while, and it hasn’t been the best couple of months for Spencer. Meanwhile, the movement he takes credit for naming has been riven by internal feuds over “Hailgate. ” This month, Spencer’s rebooting again: He is renting a “hub” for the   movement in a townhouse in Alexandria, Virginia. Spencer and Jason Jorjani, the    of Arktos, a publishing arm associated with the   have bought the domain name altright. com. Spencer and Jorjani met at the conference for the National Policy Institute, Spencer’s innocuously named think tank, where attendees gave Nazi salutes as Spencer shouted “Hail Trump” from the stage. They quickly formed a bond, and are now joining forces to brand themselves as the intellectual leaders of the  . Spencer’s new headquarters reflects his increasing effort to mainstream the   as its preferred candidate prepares to enter the White House, and to cement himself as its leading voice. Jorjani was down from New York this week visiting with Spencer, who will be living on the top level of the spacious loft he and Jorjani will be using in Alexandria. The loft has no furniture yet the only decor in the living room was a bottle of whiskey Spencer was working his way through around 3 p. m. on Wednesday. Upstairs, his belongings were strewn about in suitcases. The pair imagine the space as a kind of   hybrid for the   a private space where people in the movement can make videos, throw parties (there’s an outdoor patio) and work on the nascent website, which Spencer said would launch on Monday. The loft “is symbolic in that it is a headquarters of sorts,” Spencer said. The fact that Spencer and Jorjani are attempting to take ownership of the term   is likely to raise hackles in a movement whose membership is nebulous and disorganized, but often territorial and disputatious. Two factions have been battling over the Deploraball, a party planned for the night before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Spencer was uninvited from the Deploraball, which is being organized by a group called Maga3X. That group is associated with Mike Cernovich, who now prefers the label “new right. ” He cast out one of the party’s   known as “Baked Alaska,” after he wouldn’t stop tweeting about Jews. Baked Alaska then accused Cernovich of being a “cuck” in a Periscope video. Spencer expects his registration of altright. com may prove similarly contentious. “I’m sure this is going to be controversial because if there’s one thing you can count on it’s petty infighting and things like that,” he said. “What I want for this is to be a   shop,” Spencer said. “So basically  if you’re already in the   this will be a great place to just learn about what’s happening. If you just heard about the   just because of the URL, hopefully this will be the top hit on Google. ” Quotidian SEO concerns aside, Jorjani and Spencer have more exalted goals for their collaboration. Jorjani, an Iranian American academic, runs Arktos, which bills itself as the main publisher in English of works from the European “New Right. ” Arktos has translated works by Alexander Dugin, the   Russian philosopher whose   views have been influential on the   and has published Spencer’s former intellectual mentor Paul Gottfried. Jorjani describes Arktos as “the leading press of the  . ” “One important element of the work Richard and I are doing together is a consolidation of these kinds of rubrics,” Jorjani said. “So that we will see hopefully in the next few years, maybe sooner than that, a total integration of the European New Right and the North American  . ” They plan to use the site to publish work from Spencer’s Radix Journal, as well as Arktos and its associated journal Right On. They also plan to hire a “news hound” to aggregate stories of interest to the   from those about and by them to stories about figures like Dugin. Despite the intellectual image they’re striving for, Spencer and Jorjani don’t reject what Spencer calls the “ ” —  his term for figures like Cernovich or Infowars    Paul Joseph Watson, who he sees as insufficiently ideological to be truly   and more concerned with trolling people and developing a following online. (Cernovich took aim at Spencer after “Hailgate,” accusing Spencer of being “controlled opposition” and being “owned by the media. ” Watson has called Spencer a “white supremacist mainstream media darling. ”) Spencer said he welcomes “the kind of   Trump boostering new people who are entering the movement now who weren’t maybe even involved in politics until now. And there are a lot of these guys, the kind of   type people. I’m willing to criticize them and maybe even jab at them a little bit but I would rather they be the establishment rather than the total   of the conservative movement. ” Trump himself, though, has so far been a disappointment to Spencer. Despite encouraging signs throughout the campaign —  a slowness to disavow white nationalists, the hardline immigration policies, the hiring of former Breitbart News chairman Stephen K. Bannon —  Trump isn’t living up to the  ’s standards. Spencer dislikes several of the appointments Trump has made —  particularly some with connections to Goldman Sachs —  and feels the   hasn’t focused enough on immigration. “I would not say Hail Trump anymore,” Spencer said. “I don’t regret saying it because it was a moment of utter exuberance and craziness, but I would not say that right now. ” “I’m much more skeptical now,” he added. Still, Spencer’s gold MacBook betrays a certain taste for the  ’s style. “We live in the age of Trump,” he explained."
53312,73495,Rich Students Go to Graduate School to Get Richer,Atlantic,Mikhail Zinshteyn,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"More Americans are pursuing graduate degrees, but students from wealthier backgrounds  are most likely to earn the degrees that pay the most, a new report published by the Urban Institute shows. “I think that the idea that people from   backgrounds are so unlikely ever to get to medical school or law school is definitely a problem,” said Sandy Baum, a scholar on the economics of higher education and a   of the report. Between 1993 and 2008 the overall number of bachelor’s degree holders who enrolled in a graduate program within four years of completing their undergraduate studies ticked up from 34 percent to 39 percent. Despite making up just 14 percent of the current   population, graduate students represented 40 percent of the $1. 3 trillion   of   debt in 2014.   The realm of graduate education is   and some graduate degrees yield far higher wages than others, the report shows. Based on 2015 figures, workers with professional graduate degrees, such as doctors and lawyers, earn an average of $163, 000 a year between the ages of 45 and 54 —  typically the apex of a person’s earnings arc. By contrast, those with master’s degrees, in subjects like education or history, earn about $92, 800 annually in that age range,   bachelor’s degree holders by about $15, 000 a year. Those with doctorates make almost $144, 000 a year, on average. Nearly   of graduate students are at the master’s level. There are notable racial and economic differences associated with the types of graduate degrees students pursue and whether they complete their programs. Based on 2008 data, 39 percent of students who as undergraduates came from households in the lowest income quartile pursued graduate degrees 45 percent who came from the highest quartile of household income went on to do the same. And while 76 percent of the wealthiest quartile of students completed their graduate programs after 10 years, only 64 percent of those who grew up in the lowest quartile did so. Because of data limitations, those figures capture students who entered graduate programs in 1993. More recent data show that though a larger share of black bachelor’s degree holders go on to graduate programs than any other racial group, a quarter of that group enrolls at   institutions that are viewed as being less academically rigorous. Around 6 percent of Asian Americans, Hispanics and whites enrolled in  . Asian Americans and white students are also more likely to pursue doctoral and professional degrees than their black and Hispanic peers. The same disparities exist along economic lines. Also true: Whites, Asian Americans, and wealthier students are more likely to have completed a bachelor’s in the first place, so they account for a larger population of   students. Data from other sources show that black and Latino students each make up about 6 percent of the population enrolled in doctoral programs. Some university leaders blame the culture of recruitment for the lackluster numbers. “Everything has to be at scale or there’s no effect,” Arizona State University President Michael Crow said last year. He added that universities “have to want to do that. ” “There are all sorts of reasons why people from more affluent families would be more likely to go to graduate school,” Baum said. One may be that there’s more money around for   students to enroll at the   graduate programs. “Another reason is that they may have higher expectations about it,” she said. “If their parents went to graduate school, then going to graduate school seems like the normal thing to do. ” To be sure, graduate degrees —  even the programs that don’t lead to   incomes —  typically are a financial win for the students who complete them. And unlike the debate of whether undergraduate educations increase a student’s skill set or merely signal to employers a competency that may or may not be warranted, “Graduate education is much more vocational (than undergraduate educations),” Baum said. “You are learning very specifically how to be prepared for an occupation. ” She added: “There are people who get master’s degrees in generalized fields and they get jobs in something else. And certainly that credential has a signaling impact, but I would say that the vast majority of graduate degrees really are things that people use in their professions, and they’re required —  not just as a signal. ” And though graduate students garner less   focus than struggling   or   college students, the fact that disparities exist along racial and socioeconomic lines worries Baum. “It is a barrier to upward mobility,” she said. Baum wonders whether a state or federal program could target   students while they’re in college to encourage them to pursue graduate programs that lead to some of the highest wages, like medicine and law. Creating a targeted program is tricky because by the time students have completed their bachelor’s, the typical telltale signs of financial need are gone because these students are   adults who likely live independent of their parents. Some graduates of business or law schools already can receive substantial indirect perks for the degrees they’ve earned. Through   repayment, which many   borrowers are eligible for,   graduates with master’s degrees in   fields can benefit from lower payments and loan forgiveness if they’re working for government or nonprofit employers. “It doesn’t seem like the top of the social agenda to make sure we forgive those loans for those people,” Baum said. Republicans and   Trump have proposed tweaks to the   repayment plan that may limit the benefits graduate students receive, though tax reform and Obamacare appear to be higher priorities on the incoming administration’s agenda.

53313,73496,There Are No Happy Endings in A Series of Unfortunate Events ,Atlantic,Lenika Cruz,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Since its debut in 1999, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events has stood out for being a children’s series that didn’t believe in happy endings. The popular books followed three young siblings whose parents die in a fire and who are placed in the care of one hapless or unsavory guardian after another, all the while being hunted by an evil distant relative hungry for their enormous fortune. Page after page proved verbose, fatalistic, dark —  and utterly engrossing, thanks in part to the series’s enigmatic narrator, its macabre sensibility, and its wonky literariness. But more than anything it always seemed to assume the best of its young readers, believing they possessed the emotional and intellectual maturity to enjoy such a tale. A decade after the 13th and final book was released, the series is set to find a new audience, and   an older one, when a TV adaptation from Netflix premieres Friday. After a (rather bad) 2004 movie version starring Jim Carrey, many book fans greeted news of the show with skepticism. Luckily, the unfortunate story of the Baudelaire orphans seems to have finally gotten a worthy adaptation. Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events makes an impressive effort to stay true to the spirit and idiosyncrasies of the books without being overly reverential. (It helps that the series’s real author, Daniel Handler, is an executive producer and the show’s writer.) The result is a show that’s likely to appeal to both adults and children with its layers of mystery, a weird sense of humor, and    —  as long as viewers can accept the misery that lies ahead. The show revolves around the three kind and clever Baudelaire orphans and the vast, complicated mystery they begin to unearth about their parents. There’s    Violet, an avid inventor (played by Malina Wiessman)    Klaus, a voracious bookworm (Louis Hynes) and their baby sister Sunny, who’s a whiz at biting stuff (Presley Smith). And then there’s the cruel and calculating Count Olaf (played by Neil Patrick Harris) —  the Baudelaire’s first guardian whose sole interest is stealing their wealth, with the help of his coterie of henchmen. The first season of the show spans the first four books of the series with each episode roughly 45 minutes long, a pacing that allows the characters and storylines room to breathe. (The entire season was provided to critics.) Crucial to the narrative is the fictional Lemony Snicket himself. As played by an understated Patrick Warburton, Snicket is the omnipresent narrator he is in the books: interrupting the story so often the “fourth wall” feels more like a door, wandering into the frame   to define words or offer commentary, and repeatedly urging viewers to spend their time in some other, more pleasant way. Warburton’s   almost bored delivery won’t jibe with everyone, but it does help to balance out the more fantastical elements of the show. Much of the Baudelaires’ time is spent trying to   Count Olaf using their unique skills, whether it’s decoding cryptic letters or inventing   tools. A running theme is the sheer incompetence of the adults and authority figures around the siblings —  and the way institutions meant to protect them, such as schools and the legal system, end up spectacularly failing them. Sometimes, the misfortunes that befall the children feel so sadistic as to strain believability without spoiling, various subplots involve leeches, gruesome workplace accidents, hurricanes, snake bites, and chores. To its credit, the show doesn’t downplay the darkness that’s at the core of A Series of Unfortunate Events. But the director Barry Sonnenfeld (The Addams Family, the Men in Black trilogy) introduces levity elsewhere. One of the great delights of Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events is the   aided by stunning production design that translates the books to screen while adding new flourishes. It was never clear exactly when or where the story of the books takes place: The series is riddled with playful anachronisms, from the characters’   outfits to steampunk technology, and mixes real geographical references (Arizona, Peru, Winnipeg) with invented ones (Lake Lachrymose). The show similarly has fun fleshing out the Baudelaires’ world. It modernizes the story a bit with the internet and smartphones, while tossing in a new set of amusing cultural references (Sonic Youth, Haruki Murakami, Uber). As Violet, Klaus, and Sunny bounce from place to place, viewers catch glimpses of this peculiar universe: a country road that reeks of horseradish, a lake that experiences hurricanes, a menagerie of outlandish reptiles. The rest of the show’s levity comes from the cast, who bring to life a script that lurches between bizarre and mundane. While the   version of Count Olaf felt like exactly what it was —  Jim Carrey being very Jim   but in prosthetics and heavy makeup —  Harris’s take on the villain is more faithful. The difficulty of portraying Olaf lies in capturing the inherent ridiculousness of his character along with how frightening he is. Harris succeeds unevenly, but fills in the gaps with physical comedy, hilarious deadpanning, and   theatricality. The actors who play the older Baudelaires, Wiessman and Hynes, are terrific and instantly likable, ably holding their own against more experienced actors. As for the supporting cast: Joan Cusack, Aasif Mandvi, K. Todd Freeman, Alfre Woodard, and Rhys Darby all deliver   performances as some of the hapless adults who try to look after the Baudelaires. (Mandvi, Freeman, and Woodard play characters who, in both the film and the books, were portrayed as white.) There are also a couple of surprise characters who were mentioned but never actually showed up in the books —  just one of the many ways the show builds beyond the original material. While the medium doesn’t always work to the story’s benefit —  the theme song sounds a lot like a Panic! at the Disco   imploring viewers to “Look away, look away,” and some of the digital effects fall horribly flat —  Netflix’s decision to adapt A Series of Unfortunate Events into a TV show seems, in many ways, inevitable. The books check all the streaming service’s boxes for an original series: a beloved franchise (Gilmore Girls, Full House) that never got its proper due (Arrested Development) and fits the   model. As a weird and expansive series, it’s also tonally and thematically akin to the likes of Stranger Things, The OA, and Jessica Jones, though a bit wackier. As could be expected for a show with a metafictional bent, there are some winking (and slightly  ) references to the glories of longform,   TV peppered throughout. All of which is to say that A Series of Unfortunate Events could end up being one of Netflix’s more exciting adaptations. Handler has said the next season will be 10 episodes long and stretch through book nine (The Carnivorous Carnival) which means the third season should be the last. The series (mild spoiler) becomes increasingly philosophical and grim as it progresses, even more so than J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books. It’ll be fascinating to see whether Netflix will have the wisdom to shed some of the whimsy and darken its tone accordingly in the coming years. The first season, at least, is a more than promising start —  compelling even if, by the eighth episode, viewers have come to accept that the story of the Baudelaires won’t have a storybook ending."
53314,73497,What Is Marine Le Pen Doing at Trump Tower?  ,Atlantic,Rosie Gray,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"The French   leader Marine Le Pen made an unannounced visit to Trump Tower on Thursday for reasons that remain mysterious. Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front, was spotted by the press pool having coffee with three men in the basement of Trump Tower. According to the pool report, Le Pen declined to answer when asked if she was meeting with the  . The visit comes at an important time for Le Pen, who is scheduled to officially launch her presidential campaign next month in Lyon and who is expected to reach the second round of the presidential election this year. Le Pen is one of the clarion voices of the European nationalist right, and has in recent years made efforts to reform her party’s xenophobic image in a “ ” campaign. Despite Le Pen’s presence in Trump Tower, a top Trump aide said she had not arranged a meeting with Trump. Asked about Le Pen’s being in New York earlier on Thursday, incoming White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said he hadn’t “seen anything nor seen a request. ” Asked if Le Pen was meeting with Trump following the pool spotting her at Trump Tower, Bannon said no. Le Pen’s spokesman told Bloomberg earlier that a potential meeting with Trump was “not on her public agenda. ” According to the pool, Le Pen was sitting with her partner and deputy Louis Aliot, as well as George Lombardi, an Italian businessman who has arranged contacts between Trump and European political figures, according to Politico. Lombardi later spoke to the reporters at Trump Tower and told them that Le Pen had not sought a meeting with Trump. “We did not reach out to the Trump campaign. We did not reach out to Mr. Trump, even though he’s a friend of mine,” Lombardi said, according to the pool report. Lombardi, who lives in Trump Tower, said that Le Pen had attended a party there the previous evening, and that she had met people in New York who could help her raise money for her campaign but that she has not asked Trump for help in that regard: “That wouldn’t be proper. ” Lombardi said Le Pen plans to go to Washington on Friday. Trump has met with other European populists since being elected president, such as former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, one of the leading Brexit campaigners, and Matteo Salvini of Italy’s Northern League."
53315,73498,Bacteria Send Electrical Pulses as Recruitment Ads,Atlantic,Ed Yong,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Bacteria are simple, supposedly. Each one consists of a single microscopic cell. But together, these cells have a surprisingly rich social life, and are capable of unexpectedly complex behaviors. For example, a team of scientists led by Gürol Süel from the University of California, San Diego, now has shown that groups of bacteria can coordinate their actions and bolster their ranks by sending   electrical signals, not unlike those that course along our neurons and power our thoughts. When bacteria find themselves on solid surfaces, they can secrete a large, slimy framework called a “biofilm,” which they then inhabit. These biofilms are everywhere. You find them on rocks and boat hulls, on shower heads and catheters, and on your teeth in the form of dental plaque. They are the equivalent of bacterial cities, where multicultural communities of microbes   in a bustling   world. Two years ago, Süel’s colleague Jintao Liu noticed something odd about the way these cities emerge. By allowing a soil bacterium called Bacillus subtilus to create biofilms under controlled conditions, he realized that it did so in a jerky way. The biofilm would expand and stop, expand and stop, again and again, with each cycle taking two hours. Without those pauses, the cells in the center of the biofilm would run out of food and starve to death. Those on the edges would then become more vulnerable. So by periodically stopping the outer individuals from multiplying, the bacteria allow time for nutrients to reach the central cells, which benefits the entire community. For years, scientists have known that bacteria can coordinate their behavior by exchanging specific chemicals —  a  process known as quorum sensing. But Süel’s bacteria were doing something else. Arthur Pringle, another member of the team, realized that they were exchanging electrical messages rather than chemical ones. On their surface, bacteria have small pores called ion channels, which allow electrically charged molecules to move in and out of the cells. When the bacteria in the center of the biofilms start to starve, they open some of these pores, allowing positively charged potassium ions to stream outwards. When neighboring cells detect these ions, they also open their pores and release their own potassium. The result is a wave of charged ions —  an electrical pulse —  that ripples through the biofilm, right to its edges. This is very similar to what happens when neurons fire. They are lined with ion channels, too. When one opens, ions stream through and trigger nearby channels to open as well, creating a traveling electrical pulse. In neurons, this happens down the lengths of single cells. In the bacteria, it happens over large communities of cells. But otherwise, the principle is the same. Indeed, scientists have long studied bacterial ion channels to better understand their counterparts in neurons, without understanding how the microbes themselves use such channels. Süel’s team provides one answer: The channels allow bacteria to talk to each other at a distance. These messages can even extend beyond the boundaries of a biofilm.  Jacqueline Humphries, one of the team’s members, has shown that once the wave of potassium ions hits the edge of a B. subtilis biofilm, it continues to diffuse outwards. When other B. subtilis cells in the surrounding hinterlands pick up these ions, they switch on a   motor and end up swimming towards the potassium source. Humphries could see this happening under a microscope, by tracking the bacteria with florescent dyes. As soon as the potassium wave reaches the boundaries of biofilm, the microbes outside would start swimming over.   “The amazing thing is that potassium ions are an essential currency for all cells,” says Humphries. So while she initially worked with B. subtilis, she realized that the electrical signals ought to be able to summon other bacteria of any species. To test that idea, she exposed the B. subtilis biofilms to Pseudomonas aeruginosa —  another species from a very distant trunk of the bacterial family tree. These two species shouldn’t be able to communicate with each other through, say, quorum sensing. But electrical messages ought to work just fine. “I remember sitting in the dark microscope room, waiting for the images to come in,” she says. When the P. aeruginosa cells started swimming towards the B. subtilis ones, she watched it happening. “It was a really satisfying moment. ” “This is amazing work that reshapes how we think about bacterial interactions and biofilm formation,” says Helen Blackwell, from the University of   who was not involved in the study. “It shows us a simple and generic way for many different bacteria to interact thorough electrical signals. ” Think about it this way. When bacteria communicate chemically, it’s like each family is speaking with its own language, relying on its own particular assortment of chemicals and receptors. By contrast, the electrical signals that Süel’s team discovered are more like mathematics —  something universal. “It allows species to communicate across evolutionary divides and create mixed communities,” says Humphries. “It’s changed my perspective on biofilms. ” Many biofilms are incredibly ordered. Those in your mouth, for example, are structured like a rainforest, with some species living in the canopy, while others crowd in the floor. It’s natural to assume that they develop in this way. “But maybe that’s not the case,” says Humphries. “Maybe they just send out these ads, get whom they can, and then work out how to live together. ” “It’s a fascinating development,” says  Julia van Kessel from Indiana University. She now wants to know how far the signals can travel, how they fare in different environments, and how they might activate the genes of the microbes they attract. For Karine Gibbs from Harvard University, the critical question is: “What is the fate of cells pulled in by these signals?” she wonders. Some of them end up within the biofilm itself, but could they be eaten by the native cells? Are the biofilm bacteria luring in outsiders for food? Could they be “like the mythical Sirens calling ships to the shore?” Gibbs wonders."
53316,73499,Why Killer Whales (and Humans) Go Through Menopause,Atlantic,Ed Yong,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Granny hasn’t been seen since last October, and those who know her suspect that she’s dead. She was an orca, or killer whale —  part of a   group called   that lives in the Pacific Northwest. That pod has been studied by scientists for over 40 years, and Granny has always been a common sight, identifiable by the small   notch in her back fin and the grey saddle patch behind it. Based on those sightings, and on Granny’s family ties, researchers have estimated that she was at least 74 years old at the time of her disappearance, and as possibly as old as 105. The exact length of her life will never be known —  her body hasn’t been found and is probably forever lost to the Pacific. But what’s clear is this: Granny had stopped reproducing sometime before humans got to know her. In the last four decades, she has never given birth to a calf. “I find that absolutely incredible,” says Darren Croft from the University of Exeter. “Her longevity isn’t the interesting thing  it’s her life without a calf. ” Almost all animals reproduce until they die, even very   ones like elephants and blue whales. As far as we know, just three species buck the trend: killer whales,   pilot whales, and humans. Women go through menopause between 45 and 55 even though they live for a long time more the same is true for   without access to modern medicine. Likewise, female killer whales stop reproducing in their 30s or 40s, but might live for decades more. That’s an evolutionary mystery. Why give up so many chances to pass your genes to the next generation? This question is really two separate ones. First, why stop reproducing early? Second, why survive beyond that point? Let’s start with the second. A popular idea called the “grandmother hypothesis” proposed in the 1960s, says that older women play a vital role in helping to feed, raise, and teach their children and grandchildren. In doing so, they’re still ensuring the success of their genetic legacy. There’s some evidence for this in humans: one study of Finns and Canadians found that women who live longest after menopause end up with more grandchildren, because their daughters are better at having and raising kids. The same is true for killer whales. We know this because scientists led by Ken Balcomb have spent the last 40 years monitoring the lives, family ties, and deaths of the Pacific Northwest orcas —  Granny included. In 2012, Croft, Balcomb, and student Emma Foster used that census to show that mothers clearly help their children to survive —  and their sons in particular. If a male orca’s mother dies, his odds of joining her in the following year go up by three times if he’s younger than thirty, by eight times if he’s older than 30, and by a whopping 14 times if the mother was  . So mother orcas, especially older ones, are somehow helping to keep their sons alive (and older sons in particular). Croft’s colleague Lauren Brent worked out how in 2015. Using hundreds of hours of video footage, she showed that older females guide their pods —  especially males —  to hotspots of salmon, which make up the vast majority of their diet. “These whales live on a knife edge and this knowledge about when and where to find food is vital for keeping the group alive,” says Croft. That’s partly why Granny’s death was so sad. “She had a very important role to play, and her pod is in a really difficult place. ” But none of this explains why female orcas (or humans, for that matter) should forgo reproduction early. Sure, they use their knowledge to help their families, but why not continue to expand those families by having more children? After all, that’s what elephants do. The oldest matriarchs guide their herds to sources of water, and teach them the right   strategies, all while continuing to reproduce. In humans, orcas, and elephants, grandmothers matter —  yet only in the first two are they also infertile. Why? The answer lies not in cooperation, but in conflict. Animals that raise their young in groups don’t have infinite resources. There’s only so much food, attention, and care to go around. So adding an extra child to the mix —  another mouth to feed, another body to watch —  is partly an act of competition. And the outcome of that competition depends on the family structure of each species. Among ancestral humans, sons tended to stay with their mothers while daughters moved out to join new families. When one such daughter begins her new life, she’s initially unrelated to anyone around her. With no relatives to help, her best way of passing her genes to the next generation is to have children. As she does, she becomes increasingly related to her new family group, and shares more and more genes with them. Now, she can also enhance her genetic legacy by helping her own relatives raise their children. She may even be better off doing so if she had any more children, they would be in direct competition with her existing descendants.   So, as Rufus Johnstone and Michael Cant from the University of Cambridge showed in 2008, evolutionary theory predicts that that older women are better off if they stop reproducing and focus on helping their kin. Because of the family dynamics in our species, menopause should naturally evolve. That’s not true for elephants. In their societies, daughters stay at home, while sons leave. This means that females are surrounded by female relatives throughout their lives, and theory predicts that their strategies shouldn’t change with time. A matriarch’s best bet is to carry on reproducing for as long as she can. (Some sources wrongly claim that elephants go through menopause some individuals might stop reproducing early, especially in captivity, but the species as a whole does not.) Killer whales (and   pilot whales) have different social structures again, where both sons and daughters stay with their mothers. Females will happily mate with outsiders, but they always return to their birth pod to raise their calves. This means that young females are relatively unrelated to the males in their group after all, their fathers come from different pods. But as she gets older, her relatedness to nearby males increases as she accumulates sons and grandsons. This leads to essentially the same pattern as in humans: female orcas become increasingly more related to their neighbors as they get older. Croft’s group, together with Cant and Johnstone, have now confirmed this pattern by looking at the shifting family ties of the Pacific Northwest orcas. And by building a mathematical simulation, they predicted that it leads to the same outcome: Orcas ought to evolve menopause, because younger females benefit more from having children, while older ones benefit more by helping their offspring. That’s also evident in the records. The team showed that if two generations of killer whales breed at the same time, the death rates for calves born to older mothers are 1. 7 times higher than for those born to younger mothers. “This explains why it is a better option for older females to stop having more calves and instead focus on helping their existing calves, for example by using their lifetime of accumulated knowledge to lead the family to good feeding grounds,” says Hazel Nichols from Liverpool John Moores University, who studies mammal societies. Why do the new calves of older mothers do so poorly? It’s not clear. These animals share food, so perhaps younger females are hoarding more for themselves, or sharing exclusively with their own young. Or perhaps they’re less likely to babysit or suckle another female’s child. “There’s this    between older and younger females,” says Croft. “It’s not just that the older ones are stepping back and saying: It’s your turn. It’s also that the younger generation is chomping at the bit to reproduce. And this reproductive conflict, when taken together with the benefits of grandmothers, can unravel the mystery of why menopause evolved. ” That was only possible because Balcomb and others have spent decades amassing data on the Pacific Northwest orcas. “It’s probably the only data set where we can test the generality of the evolutionary theory that was developed for humans,” says Croft. Rebecca Sear from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has studied menopause in humans, agrees. “Working with humans, I am incredibly fortunate in being able to download data at the click of mouse, so I’m filled with awe at the work involved in collecting this kind of demographic data on this kind of species,” she says. “There isn’t an overwhelming amount of empirical evidence in humans that older women really suffer higher costs in reproductive conflict with younger women, but that may be because few studies have actually tested for this yet. ” It’s hard to do so for humans, because modern medicine has so utterly reduced mortality and increased longevity. With killer whales, it’s almost the opposite. “We’ve fished the salmon out, polluted their water, and disturbed them with industrialization,” says Croft. “They’re really, really struggling. ” And now, with Granny gone, her children and grandchildren face an even more uncertain future."
53317,73500,"On The Tonight Show, Michelle Obama Cements a Legacy of Empathy",Atlantic,Megan Garber,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"In late November of 1963, the journalist Teddy White traveled to Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to meet with a young woman who had just been made a widow. White made the trip to profile Jackie Kennedy, to tell her story of resilience and mourning to a nation in need of hope what soon became clear, however, was that the woman in question had other ideas about the story White would write. The piece he would publish in Life magazine would be about Jackie —  that’s what the public wanted —  but it would be more essentially, she insisted, about her husband and his legacy. White complied. He wrote the rough draft of that story Jackie herself edited it into its role as a rough draft of history. The piece about Jackie ultimately ran under the title “For President Kennedy: An Epilogue,” and it established the myth —  Jackie saw to it —  that her husband would be remembered not just as a fallen hero, but also as, for too brief a time, the leader of Camelot. Michelle Obama, Jackie’s heir as first lady, is similarly engaged in purposeful   as her tenure in the role draws to a close. And she is similarly savvy about the ways the American media can assist in that effort. Obama’s farewell notably differs from her predecessor’s —  not just in the circumstances of her departure, but in, perhaps more significantly, the aim of their  : The legacy she is building is hers. Obama, in her recent media appearances —  in a soaring speech, in a fantastic interview with Oprah —  hasn’t merely been burnishing her husband’s place in history. She has been establishing her own. On Wednesday Obama appeared, for her final time as first lady, on The Tonight Show —  the program’s only guest for the evening save for Stevie Wonder, who had been invited on to serenade her with a modified “My Michelle, Amour. ” The hour —  which included, among other segments, a standard   interview, a game of Catchphrase, and a set piece that found Obama and Fallon writing   notes —  was one of cheerful elegy. It was, overall, a loving tribute to the first lady and her many accomplishments in the role. It was also an   endorsement not just of Obama’s legacy, but of the politics of empathy she has embraced during her time in the White House. Jackie Kennedy may have brought glamour to the people’s house, determinedly insisting on America’s significance not just as a geopolitical power, but as a cultural force Obama may herself have been an icon of style, but she insisted that glamour isn’t enough. She advocated for kids, and for their education, and for their health. She spoke up for military families. She gave hugs, with abandon. She cared, out loud. Her Tonight Show appearance celebrated —  and codified —  all of that. So it was appropriate that the most striking segment of the hour found Obama interacting directly with her fans. Fallon, playing an extremely 2017 version of Teddy White, had arranged a   in which citizens could tell Obama, via a   message, what she has meant to them —  professionally, personally, as a role model. The first lady would then, as the people concluded their messages, emerge from behind a curtain to surprise them with her presence. Shock, and hugs, and tears, and so many feels, ensued. What also ensued, however, was a legacy being bolstered, sentence by sentence, by the people who have benefited from it. “Because of you,” one woman told Obama, “I know that my race does not define who I am or what I can accomplish. For years, you have shown our nation countless times, that through dignity, compassion, and respect, we can overcome any hardships. ” Another: “First Lady Michelle Obama, thank you for making me a more confident woman. You have helped me and inspired me to walk in my purpose. ” Another: “I feel the same way about you that I feel about the best teachers I’ve ever had. ” Another: “You’re all class, and a total inspiration to all of us  …    . it was amazing to see a woman with your strength and kindness and just amazingness could have fun on camera. And we’re gonna miss you so much. ” First ladies, like their husbands, reflect their times. Jackie Kennedy’s was an age when women were thought of largely as accessories to men, and were loved, generally, at a distance. (One of the final scenes in Jackie, the 2016 film that tells the story of her interactions with Teddy White, finds the young widow gazing on a series of mannequins that have been styled to mimic her.) Michelle Obama has embraced glamour, too (those dresses!) she, too, has had a tenure of inspiring images. As her appearance on The Tonight Show made clear, though, her legacy, as befits her times, will be defined much more by her work —  by her advocacy for those who cannot advocate for themselves, and by, finally, her insistence on empathy. As one man put it on Wednesday in his video message to Obama, before she emerged from the curtain to surprise him with a hug: “The thread that runs through your speeches is kindness. Always kindness. ”"
53318,73501,Is Obamacare Just Bad Branding?,Atlantic,Olga Khazan,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"The Senate began the process of dismantling Obamacare early Thursday morning, passing a budget blueprint that sets the stage for a formal repeal vote, potentially within a few weeks. The step is, for now, procedural, but it signals Republican lawmakers are following through on their longstanding promises to axe the law. In his press conference this week,   Donald Trump assured Americans once again that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced, “essentially, simultaneously. ” The pesky details are still TBD, as he explained: “It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour. ” But the implication is clear: “So we’re gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff,” he said, repeating one of his favorite lines: “Obamacare is a complete and total disaster. ” This, for some, raises the question: How much of the   is about its namesake? Obamacare certainly has its warts, but Republicans have not coalesced around a replacement plan that would insure as many people while offering them the same choices and costing less. Would a   law by any other name be such a political lightning rod? Obama’s opponents were already calling the Affordable Care Act “Obamacare” in 2011, when Obama himself reclaimed the moniker. “They call it ObamaCare?” he said, as the Hill reported at the time. “I have no problem with people saying Obama cares. I do care. ” This was after some of the law’s more popular provisions —  like allowing people to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until they’re 26 —  snapped into place, but before the rollout of the more controversial individual mandate and cantankerous website. At the time, Obama tried to frame it as though only the truly heartless could be against something ending in  . “If the other side wants to be the folks that don’t care,” he said, “that’s fine with me. ” Of course later, when the Obamacare plans became too expensive for some people, “care” is not the part of the name Obama’s opponents seized on. After a few years of rate hikes and narrow networks, a slight majority of Americans disapprove of the Affordable Care Act, and it has become easier for Republicans to advocate for repealing it by associating it with the failures of a liberal, departing president. Trump almost exclusively calls it Obamacare, and Republicans often frame repeal as “relief from Obamacare. ” Still, the majority of people who are actually on Obamacare plans or Medicaid are satisfied with their coverage, according to the Commonwealth Fund, and only 20 percent of survey respondents told the Kaiser Family Foundation they want the law repealed before the details of a replacement are made clear. In other words, the people who benefit from Obamacare are happy with it, and Americans’ zeal for wantonly scrapping the law, if it ever was fervent, seems to have dampened. All of this makes it tempting to think Obamacare would not be on the ropes if it had been called literally anything else. Like KFC and Healthy Choice, maybe all it needs is a good,   face lift. A bold new look, same great taste. “Obamacare does not have a policy problem,” argued The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell recently. “It has a branding problem. ” Is that really all it is? Some people who dislike Obama might allow their disdain to permeate everything he’s done —  including laws that objectively help them. This helps explain why conservative Medicaid recipients in Indiana told The New York Times they want Obamacare gone, even though the law paid for their cancer treatment. Or why some Pennsylvanians told me they want subsidies for health insurance, just not Obamacare subsidies. Indeed, some surveys suggest people view the law more favorably when Obama’s name isn’t mentioned. It’s a kind of reverse “halo effect,” says Scott Rick, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Michigan. “If you already like someone, anything new they do gets the benefit of the doubt. If you already dislike someone, everything they subsequently touch is tainted. For many conservatives, Obamacare is the fruit of a poisonous tree. ” Some states have found the label so toxic that, in an effort to boost enrollment, they hid it. Kentucky expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, but the state called it “Kentucky Connect” (portmanteau’d to “Kynect”) because, as Obama told Vox recently, “I don’t poll that well in Kentucky. ” But not all Obamacare hate is misplaced Obama hate. “I believe there is certainly many individual cases where maybe the law’s unintended consequences of narrower networks and higher deductibles was a factor in their displeasure,” said G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president with the Bipartisan Policy Center and former staffer for Republican senators. “And the initial   suggested for many that government could not handle such a major change in policy. ” And     is not necessarily misplaced, either. Even Obamacare supporters had their faith shaken by Obama’s broken promises about keeping existing plans, premiums declining by $2, 500, and the disastrous website  . Hoagland believes a   name wouldn’t have spared the law peoples’ wrath. And a more anodyne nickname —  say, “Faircare” —  might not have stuck as firmly as Obamacare did. “It already had just about the most innocuous name possible: the Affordable Care Act,” Rick said. “That name, in and of itself, is insightful branding. ” “Unfortunately,” he added, “Obamacare is even better branding. ” Obamacare —  with its pleasant pattern of long and short vowels and its echo of   Medicare  —  is, for better or worse, easy to remember, said John E. McDonough, a Harvard professor who worked on the Affordable Care Act. “Easier even than Affordable Care Act —  which I, to this day, hear people mangle (i. e.: Accountable Care Act, Affordable Coverage Act, etc. ),” he added. It’s conceivable Obamacare could have saved itself from its name by working better. If people weren’t so dissatisfied with their networks and deductibles, perhaps they would have embraced Obamacare —  and, in turn, Hillary Clinton, who promised to build on it, rather than destroy it. But even McDonough doubts that would have prevented “Obamacare” from catching on, and, eventually, being contaminated. “It feels similar to ‘ ’ in the early 1990s —  once it was out there, it was almost impossible to shake,” he said. In embracing the label, the Obama administration was wrong to think people would like their new plans enough to override the relentless criticism of the law, he added. Perhaps Obamacare, and Hillarycare before it, is a cautionary tale for what some are now recommending: Simply tweaking Obamacare slightly and renaming it “Trumpcare. ” Health insurance and politicians are two of the country’s   entities —  it’s probably not wise to combine the two. Medicare was not called Johnsoncare, after all. And Romneycare, Massachusetts’s   Obamacare predecessor, did pose a bit of a problem when its eponymous governor ran for president in 2012, but it was eclipsed by bigger issues. Rick, the branding expert, thinks perhaps the Republicans should name their replacement bill something that will resonate better with conservatives. “Adding ‘freedom,’ ‘liberty,’ or ‘responsible’ to the title might help,” he said. “Maybe the ‘Responsible Coverage Act.’ I say ‘coverage’ instead of ‘care’ because for some conservatives, ‘care’ may sound too feminine. ” But, you know, you’re going to want to   that “Freedom Coverage” first."
53319,73502,What Happens If You Stick Your Head in a Particle Accelerator? ,Atlantic,Joel Frohlich,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"What would happen if you stuck your body inside a particle accelerator? The scenario seems like the start of a bad Marvel comic, but it happens to shed light on our intuitions about radiation, the vulnerability of the human body, and the very nature of matter. Particle accelerators allow physicists to study subatomic particles by speeding them up in powerful magnetic fields and then tracing the interactions that result from collisions. By delving into the mysteries of the universe, colliders have entered the zeitgeist and tapped the wonders and fears of our age. As far back as 2008, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) was charged with creating microscopic black holes that would allow physicists to detect extra dimensions. To many, this sounds like the plot of a disastrous   movie. It came as no surprise when two people filed a lawsuit to stop the LHC from operating, lest it produce a black hole powerful enough to destroy the world. But physicists argued that the idea was absurd and the lawsuit was rejected. Then, in 2012, the LHC detected the   Higgs boson, a particle needed to explain how particles acquire mass. With that major accomplishment, the LHC entered popular culture it was featured on the album cover of Super Collider (2013) by the heavy metal band Megadeth, and was a plot point in the U. S. television series The Flash (2014). Yet, despite its accomplishments and glamour, the world of particle physics is so abstract that few understand its implications, meaning, or use. Unlike a NASA probe sent to Mars, CERN’s research doesn’t produce stunning, tangible images. Instead, the study of particle physics is best described by chalkboard equations and squiggly lines called Feynman diagrams. Aage Bohr, the Nobel laureate whose father Niels invented the Bohr model of the atom, and his colleague Ole Ulfbeck have even gone as far as to deny the physical existence of subatomic particles as anything more than mathematical models. Which returns us to our original question: What happens when a beam of subatomic particles traveling at nearly the speed of light meets the flesh of the human body? Perhaps because the realms of particle physics and biology are conceptually so far removed, it’s not only laypeople who lack the intuition to answer this question, but also some professional physicists. In a 2010 YouTube interview with members of the physics and astronomy faculty at the University of Nottingham, several academic experts admitted that they had little idea what would happen if one were to stick a hand inside the proton beam at the LHC. Professor Michael Merrifield put it succinctly: “That’s a good question. I don’t know is the answer. Probably be very bad for you. ” Professor Laurence Eaves was also cautious about drawing conclusions. “[B]y the scales of energy we notice, it wouldn’t be that noticeable,” he said, likely with a bit of British understatement. “Would I put my hand in the beam? I’m not sure about that. ” Such thought experiments can be useful tools for exploring situations that can’t be studied in the laboratory. Occasionally, however, unfortunate accidents yield case studies: Opportunities for researchers to study scenarios that can’t be experimentally induced for ethical reasons. Case studies have a sample size of one and no control group. But, as the neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran has pointed out in Phantoms in the Brain (1998) it takes only one talking pig to prove that pigs can talk. On September 13, 1848, for example, an iron rod pierced through the head of the U. S. railway worker Phineas Gage and profoundly changed his personality, offering early evidence of a biological basis for personality. And on July 13, 1978, a Soviet scientist named Anatoli Bugorski stuck his head in a particle accelerator. On that fateful day, Bugorski was checking malfunctioning equipment on the   synchrotron —  the largest particle accelerator in the Soviet Union —  when a safety mechanism failed and a beam of protons travelling at nearly the speed of light passed straight through his head, Phineas  . It’s possible that, at that point in history, no other human being had ever experienced a focused beam of radiation at such high energy. Although proton therapy —  a cancer treatment that uses proton beams to destroy tumors —  was pioneered before Bugorski’s accident, the energy of these beams is generally not above 250 million electron volts (a unit of energy used for small particles). Bugorski might have experienced the full wrath of a beam with more than 300 times this much energy, 76 billion electron volts. Proton radiation is a rare beast indeed. Protons from the solar wind and cosmic rays are stopped by Earth’s atmosphere, and proton radiation is so rare in radioactive decay that it was not observed until 1970. More familiar threats, such as ultraviolet photons and alpha particles, do not penetrate the body past skin unless a radioactive source is ingested. Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, for instance, was killed by alpha particles that do not so much as penetrate paper when he unknowingly ingested radioactive   delivered by an assassin. But when Apollo astronauts protected by spacesuits were exposed to cosmic rays containing protons and even more exotic forms of radiation, they reported flashes of visual light, a harbinger of what would welcome Bugorski on the fateful day of his accident. According to an interview in Wired magazine in 1997, Bugorski immediately saw an intense flash of light but felt no pain. The young scientist was taken to a clinic in Moscow with half his face swollen, and doctors expected the worst. Ionizing radiation particles such as protons wreak havoc on the body by breaking chemical bonds in DNA. This assault on a cell’s genetic programming can kill the cell, stop it from dividing, or induce a cancerous mutation. Cells that divide quickly, such as stem cells in bone marrow, suffer the most. Because blood cells are produced in bone marrow, for instance, many cases of radiation poisoning result in infection and anemia from losses of white blood cells and red blood cells, respectively. But unique to Bugorski’s case, radiation was concentrated along a narrow beam through the head, rather than being broadly distributed from nuclear fallout, as was the case for many victims of the Chernobyl disaster or the bombing of Hiroshima. For Bugorski, particularly vulnerable tissues, such as bone marrow and the gastrointestinal track, might have been largely spared. But where the beam shot through Bugorski’s head, it deposited an obscene amount of radiation energy, hundreds of times greater than a lethal dose by some estimates. And yet, Bugorski is still alive today. Half his face is paralyzed, giving one hemisphere of his head a strangely young appearance. He is reported to be deaf in one ear. He suffered at least six generalized   seizures. Commonly known as grand mal seizures, these are the seizures most frequently depicted in film and television, involving convulsions and loss of consciousness. Bugorski’s epilepsy is likely a result of   scarring left by the proton beam. It has also left him with petit mal or absence seizures, far less dramatic staring spells during which consciousness is briefly interrupted. There are no reports that Bugorski has ever been diagnosed with cancer, though that is often a   consequence of radiation exposure. Despite having nothing less than a particle accelerator beam pass through his brain, Bugorski’s intellect remained intact, and he successfully completed his doctorate after the accident. Bugorski survived his accident. And as frightening and awesome as the inside of a particle accelerator might be, humanity has thus far survived the nuclear age, This piece appears courtesy of Aeon Magazine. "
53320,73503,Could Cancer Drugs Treat Autism?,Atlantic,Alisa Opar,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Five years ago, on Charlie Ryan’s second birthday, a big lump mysteriously formed on the side of his abdomen. At the emergency room his parents took him to, doctors suggested the lump was a hernia caused by some unknown trauma, and referred the family to a surgeon. The surgeon told them it was a benign tumor, and sent them home. Charlie already had a host of medical issues. He’d been born with an abnormally large head and other features of autism, including being nonverbal. Now this. Like many a baffled and worried parent, his mother, Autumn Ryan, turned to Google, typing in Charlie’s ailments and coming up with a possible cause: a mutation in PTEN, a gene that reins in cell growth. Further searching led her to websites dedicated to families whose children have PTEN mutations. It all looked familiar —  and worrisome. “I read stories of little boys who haven’t lived, descriptions of these children with a multitude of bumps all over their bodies,” Ryan recalls. “I was freaked out. ” Two years later, after visits to multiple doctors and the nine months it took for his genetic test to be analyzed, her hunch proved right. Charlie has a mutation in PTEN. Ryan immediately faxed the results to Charis Eng, a PTEN expert at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, whose name she had come across in her research. A few months later, the family made their first trip from their home in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to see Eng and her colleague, autism expert Thomas Frazier. Together, Eng and Frazier have treated more than two dozen children like Charlie —  who all have PTEN mutations, autism, and large heads. In Eng, Ryan finally found someone who understood Charlie’s condition. “It’s like going to the person who has all the knowledge in the world, and you can ask her any question,” Ryan says of Eng. Eng was first and foremost a cancer geneticist, and stumbled upon   autism through her work in that field. In 1997, she discovered the genetic root of Cowden syndrome, a rare condition characterized by   growths and a high lifetime risk of many cancers. Following people with the syndrome, as well as their unaffected family members, she noticed that a few relatives of people with Cowden syndrome have an autism diagnosis. She thought little of it it was probably a coincidence. But then Eng noticed a few more children with autism in the families. And then a few more. “We started going, ‘Huh, how come there’s all this autism in the family members? ’” she recalls. Curious to see if this trend was more than a fluke, Eng teamed up in 2004 with Merlin Butler, a clinical geneticist at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. Eng and Butler screened 18 children with an autism diagnosis and macrocephaly, because enlarged head size is a hallmark of both Cowden syndrome and autism. They found that three of the 18 children have mutations in PTEN. Mutations in PTEN have been linked to dozens of cancers, but the gene had never before been shown to have any effect on social skills or behavior. “Wow,” Eng recalls thinking. “PTEN plays a role in a neurodevelopmental disorder, too. ” The finding was so unexpected that it was a tough sell. The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine both rejected the paper. “They didn’t believe us,” says Eng, now head of the Cleveland Clinic’s Genomic Medicine Institute. “Their reaction was: ‘It’s a cancer gene. How can this be? ’” To Eng, it was perfectly plausible that a mutation in the gene could lead to autism as well as to the many cancers of Cowden syndrome. Cancer arises when PTEN mutations release their brake on cell growth and proliferation, and cells grow out of control. When PTEN mutations cause an overgrowth of nerve fibers in the brain, Eng reasoned, they might instead lead to autism. The Journal of Medical Genetics ultimately published the study in 2005. Other groups soon confirmed the findings, and today the subtype of autism with PTEN mutations and macrocephaly —  called   —  is estimated to represent up to 2 percent of all autism cases. The unexpected connection between cancer and autism isn’t limited to PTEN. In the past decade, many cellular pathways involved in cancer have been found to overlap with those implicated in autism, and dozens of genes have been linked to both. “We didn’t know, when we started out, how [the autism genes] would look,” says Michael Wigler, a molecular biologist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York who became involved in autism research after 25 years as a cancer scientist. “It turns out that they are all over the place,” says Wigler. “The body doesn’t invent each cellular system from scratch. ” The findings have sparked investigations into whether autism treatments can piggyback off of approved cancer drugs that target specific genes. They also raise concerns that Charlie and other children with autism who have mutations in known cancer genes might be at increased risk for developing malignancies. So far, scientists have no concrete answers to address this worry. “We’ve barely scratched the surface,” says Eng. * * * Most researchers agree that a combination of genetics and environmental factors lead to autism. Hundreds of genes are involved in autism, though only a fraction of these are strong candidates for the condition. Mutations are typically categorized as either ‘germline,’ meaning that someone is born with the mutation and carries it in nearly every cell of the body, or ‘somatic,’ meaning that the mutation occurs after birth and affects only a subset of the body’s cells. Cancer is usually a disease of aging, caused by somatic mutations autism, a developmental condition, is usually linked to germline glitches. So it was a surprise when autism studies started picking out genes in pathways typically associated with cancer. In several instances, the crossover emerged in much the same way it did with Cowden syndrome —  with scientists noticing autism traits in people they were treating for other conditions. That’s what happened with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) a rare condition caused by in TSC1 or TSC2. Both genes are located downstream from PTEN on a pathway known as mTOR (for mammalian target of rapamycin mutations). In people with this condition, benign tumors grow in the brain and other organs, causing seizures, lung and kidney disease and other health problems, and occasionally turn malignant. Around 20 years ago, as autism diagnoses started to rise, clinicians began to recognize that autism was strikingly common among people with TSC. Today, up to half of people with TSC are estimated to have autism. Something similar also happened with RASopathies, a group of five disorders characterized by developmental issues, tumors and skin discoloration. Katherine Rauen, chief of genomic medicine at the University of California, Davis, identified mutations in the   pathway, a   cancer pathway, as the cause of RASopathies. Around 15 years ago, Rauen began to notice that many people with RASopathies are diagnosed with autism or have   features. “When you see rare syndromes, and you see a lot of them, you start picking out patterns,” she says. In 2013, Rauen and her colleagues reported that 27 percent of people with RASopathies meet the criteria for autism. Other researchers hit upon the cancer connection directly, through deep dives into the genome. Geneticist Evan Eichler and his collaborators are sequencing the DNA of tens of thousands of children with autism as well as their unaffected family members to show that genetic mutations underlie autism. Among the first genes that popped up in their quest was CHD8, a gene that is involved in arranging DNA into tightly packed chromosomes. CHD8 also interacts with the WNT signaling pathway, which translates messages from outside cells into changes in gene expression, and has strong cancer ties. Eichler and his colleagues found that spontaneous, or de novo, mutations in CHD8 seem to cause a distinct subtype of autism with specific physical traits. When they looked at children with CHD8 mutations and autism, they noted that the children have broad foreheads, large heads,   eyes, and gastrointestinal issues. The growing number of cancer genes linked to autism piqued the curiosity of Janine LaSalle, an autism researcher at the University of California, Davis. In a study published in March, she and her colleagues reported that at least 43 genes thought to be involved in autism are also associated with cancer. Of those, 16 genes, including PTEN and CHD8, have strong autism links, and 8 others lead to   conditions such as Rett syndrome and TSC. “Some themes jumped out” from the list, says LaSalle. She saw genes involved in chromatin  —  the   complex that forms chromosomes —  DNA repair and the transmission of signals that alter cell activity. Nine genes involved in the WNT pathway alone showed up all are involved in genome maintenance, or fighting damaging assaults on DNA —  and that’s a clue. The thinking is that early in brain development, errors in pathways that maintain the genome’s integrity may lead to autism. If the mistakes happen later in life, says LaSalle, they may occur in cell types prone to tumors. There may be more to it than timing and cell type. Eng and others are delving into the specific types of mutations, too, to see whether certain kinds of mutations contribute to autism, whereas others shift the balance toward cancer.   * * * When Eng first made the autism connection in 2005, she knew she’d hit upon a mystery she couldn’t solve alone. She needed to find the right partner. As it turns out, someone else was looking for a similar meeting of minds. Clinical psychologist Thomas Frazier had just shifted his focus from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder to concentrate on autism, after his son was diagnosed with autism. Frazier and Eng, who had just moved to the Cleveland Clinic, clicked immediately. “Had we met 20 years before, we would’ve shaken hands, and that would’ve been it,” says Frazier, who now runs the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Autism. “There would have been no reason for us to collaborate. ” Eng invited Frazier to attend her weekly lab meetings. After publishing on   in 2005, Eng’s autism research had stalled, and she was eager to get it moving again. For his part, Frazier needed a mentor to guide him through genetics. When he showed up for Eng’s lab meetings, he initially had to look up words on his phone. Eng’s team would talk about the chemical modifications of DNA that alter gene expression, for example. “I had no idea what methylation was. The first year was really brutal like that,” he says, laughing. Frazier’s hard work paid off, and Eng was impressed with how deeply he came to understand genetics. “That’s really rare,” she says. The two now partner to explore what PTEN mutations do in people with autism, and hope to use their knowledge to find targeted treatments. In 2009, for instance, they began hunting for biological markers of autism, comparing people with   and those who have autism but no PTEN mutation. To understand how mutations in PTEN cause autism features, they compared 17 children who have   with three other groups: 16 children with autism and large heads, 38 with autism alone, and 14 controls. Compared with the other groups, children with   had lower PTEN protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed that they had enlarged volumes of white matter, the fibers that brain cells use to communicate. The children also had poorer working memory and slower processing skills than the children in the other groups. Taken together, says Frazier, the findings indicate that low PTEN protein levels drive white matter abnormalities, which in turn impair cognition. The next step, says Frazier, will be to pin down the exact molecular effects of the loss of PTEN protein —  an endeavor that other groups are working on as well. PTEN typically cycles between the cytoplasm (the fluid inside the cells) and the nucleus (the control center where the DNA is stored). The protein plays different roles in each location: In the nucleus, PTEN stabilizes DNA strands and plays some role in the cell cycle, whereas in the cytoplasm it plays multiple roles, including controlling cell proliferation and helping to suppress tumor activity. Eng’s lab created mice in which the PTEN protein clusters in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus, hoping to understand how the location of the protein influences brain physiology and behavior. Mice with most of the protein in the cytoplasm perform better in maze trials but display abnormal social behavior, traits that line up with those seen in people who have mild features of autism. Eng and Frazier haven’t thoroughly studied mice with PTEN primarily in the nucleus, but the mice appear to perform poorly on memory tasks and be socially withdrawn. Eng’s lab and others are also working to tease apart how PTEN mutations in autism and cancer differ. So far, they’ve found that PTEN mutations associated with autism tend to be missense mutations, in which one amino acid is replaced by another. That change drastically lowers, but does not halt, its key activity. A variety of mutations seen in cancers, by contrast, entirely disrupt PTEN, effectively halting its activity and releasing a brake that prevents tumors. Eng’s group is developing stem cell models that could pinpoint more specific differences. In cases of autism caused by mutations in other genes, it appears that the same mutation sometimes occurs in people with autism and those with cancer the difference is in when and where in the body the mutation occurs. For example, the same germline mutation in a person with   autism might also be found in someone with bladder cancer —  but only in the cells lining the bladder, and accompanied by mutations in other genes. Likewise, mutations of the TSC genes seem to have different effects in neurons than they do in other cells of the body, says Mustafa Sahin, director of the Translational Neuroscience Center at Boston Children’s Hospital. In cancer cells, the genes control cell growth and proliferation through the mTOR pathway, but in neurons, they appear to regulate connections between the cells. In mice missing one of the TSC genes, the axons —  the long, thin part of nerve cells that conduct electrical impulses —  “go to the wrong places in the brain,” Sahin says. Diffusion tensor imaging, which maps nerve fibers, also reveals abnormalities in the wiring of the corpus callosum —  the bridge between the two hemispheres of the brain —  and in language pathways in people with TSC. For now, however, the precise series of events that push development off track remain a mystery. “That’s really what we’re focusing on right now,” Sahin says. * * * There are no drugs approved to treat autism’s core features, but the cancer link offers at least one clear possibility for leapfrogging forward. Billions of dollars devoted to cancer research have produced treatments that zero in on specific mutations —  shutting down defective enzymes, for instance, or checking overactive proteins. Autism researchers are looking to borrow from cancer’s medicine cabinet. Targeted therapies devised for cancer could become “incredibly effective” for the subtypes of autism that arise from a single mutation, says Luis Parada, director of the Brain Tumor Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Parada has made mouse models for both cancer and autism, with the mice lacking genes including PTEN, TSC1, TSC2 and NFI, a gene linked to autism and pediatric cancers. In support of this hope, Sahin and others found in 2012 that mice missing TSC1 or TSC2 display   behaviors, including atypical social interactions and repetitive behaviors. Rapamycin, a compound that blocks the mTOR pathway, halts these behavioral problems and seizures. Buoyed by these results, researchers then moved into clinical trials. In 2016, Sahin completed a   trial of 47 people with TSC, aged 6 to 21 years.   of the participants received a placebo, while the rest were given everolimus, a safer analog of rapamycin that is frequently used to treat pancreatic cancer. Neither the participants nor the clinicians knew who was receiving the drug. The researchers are still analyzing the results, but so far they do not see marked improvement in cognitive function in the everolimus group compared with the placebo group. The team hasn’t yet looked at autism features such as impaired social behavior and communication. Even so, Sahin is already thinking about next steps. In mice, he says, “we can rescue   behaviors if we start the treatment early, in the first days or weeks after birth, but often not if we start much later. ” So a   treatment may not be enough to improve autism features in the age range tested. “We may have to redesign the trial to potentially look at the effects of everolimus in younger children,” he says. Eng and Frazier plan to launch their first trial of everolimus in people with   early in 2017. Rapamycin and related compounds have been shown to prevent the overgrowth of brain cells that leads to macrocephaly and   behaviors in mice lacking PTEN. Their trial will last two to three years, with participants taking the drug for six months. “We want to give the medicine time to actually show an effect,” says Frazier. The aim is to enroll 40 participants, also between 6 and 21 years of age. Judging from the people Frazier and Eng have seen at their clinic in Cleveland, however, they anticipate that the participants will skew young. “That’s when the brain is most malleable,” says Frazier. “We’ll certainly look at age as a possible moderator of treatment outcome. ” He emphasizes that although he is hopeful the drug will prove safe, and that the participants show at least a small improvement in brain function, he can’t predict the outcome of the trial. “In a wild, wild scenario, maybe their autism symptoms get better,” he says. * * * Autumn Ryan hopes Charlie will participate in the trial, but she knows that’s not a given. Eng, ever the straight shooter, has told her that Charlie, who is now 7, may be too intellectually disabled to participate. Ryan is reassured to know that even if Charlie doesn’t take part in the trial, Eng and Frazier will continue to care for him, answering questions by phone or email, and seeing him once a year when the family visits the Cleveland Clinic. It’s an arduous trip that requires two plane rides and wears out both Charlie and his mom. Yet Ryan wouldn’t skip it. “I won’t travel all day to go on vacation with Charlie,” she says, “but I will to go to the Cleveland Clinic. ” As Charlie gets older, these visits will involve more invasive tests to screen for cancer, such as colonoscopies beginning when he’s 9. Ryan worries about breast cancer, too: People with PTEN mutations have an 85 percent lifetime risk of developing that malignancy, and a drug Charlie is on to treat aggressiveness and hyperactivity, risperidone, is causing him to develop breasts. “All we can do is watch and wait,” she says. Ryan’s concerns are shared by other parents whose children are on the spectrum and have mutated cancer genes. They can’t help but worry: Are their children also at heightened risk for malignancies? In short, nobody knows for certain. A handful of studies indicate that the genetic overlap might not increase these individuals’ odds of developing cancer. In one analysis of the medical records of thousands of people with autism in California, cancer didn’t make the list of the conditions these individuals are most likely to develop. In fact, some evidence suggests that they might have an unusually low cancer risk. In another   analysis, University of Iowa researchers compared the medical records of 1, 837 people who have an autism diagnosis with those of 9, 336 controls. They found that people with autism have a lifetime cancer risk of 1. 3 percent versus 3. 9 percent in the control group. There’s not enough evidence to say that mutations in cancer genes that contribute to autism prevent malignancies, Eng cautions. No study has specifically analyzed cancer risk in people with autism who have mutations linked to cancer pathways. Eng and Frazier are collaborating with researchers at four other institutions to follow up to 100 children with   long term. They might not have to wait decades to get a signal for risk, because thyroid cancer, which can be detected with a simple ultrasound, can develop in children as young as 4. (To date, none of the 30 children with   seen at the Cleveland Clinic has developed thyroid cancer.) If people with   do develop cancer, there are several effective drugs that might be able to combat it —  some of which, like rapamycin, are the very same therapies being tested for autism. Even if Eng is successful in finding targeted treatments for people with   however, she would be helping only a small fraction of people with autism. “That’s how precision therapy works,” she says. But given her years of experience in cancer biology, Eng inevitably thinks of the parallels: Just as cancer drugs developed for one type of cancer have turned out to be effective at fighting other types, perhaps a treatment for one subtype of autism will follow a similar arc. The everolimus trial is a first step to testing this optimistic scenario. Eng’s team is looking for gene variants, or even novel pathways, that haven’t yet been identified as being important to autism. Should they hit upon anything promising, they plan to scour the enormous inventory of existing cancer drugs. “Some drug companies may have these therapies already,” Eng says. “Maybe there’s a drug they’ve shelved because it didn’t work as they’d hoped, and voilà, it targets the underlying mechanism we don’t even yet know exists. ” Ryan, meanwhile, says she knows Eng and Frazier are in for the long haul —  and so is she. “Charlie will be a part of any study that he qualifies for,” Ryan says. “We want to get as much information about this condition as possible, and to help other families as much as we can. ” This article appears courtesy of Spectrum.

53321,73504,How Swimming Classes Became an Integration Issue in Switzerland,Atlantic,Yasmeen Serhan,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled unanimously Tuesday in favor of a Swiss school’s decision not to exempt two Muslim students from its obligatory   swimming lessons, finding that the school did not violate the students’ religious freedoms as their parents claimed. Here’s what happened: In 2010, Aziz Osmanoglu and Sehabat Kocabas, Swiss nationals of Turkish origin, did not want to send their two daughters, aged 11 and    at the time, to compulsory   swimming classes at the girls’ school in the northwestern city of Basel. The couple said the lessons, which would involve their daughters wearing swimsuits in front of their male peers, violated their Muslim faith, which in some interpretations requires separation of the sexes. School authorities said exceptions could only be made for students who have reached puberty —  the school determined the girls in question had not —  and offered the girls the option to wear a burkini, a   swimsuit, to class, as well as access to   dressing areas. The school authorities warned the parents could face fines of approximately $1, 292 euros ($1, 364) if the girls continued to skip the lessons. But the girls did. The parents appealed the school’s decision to the Court of Appeal of the Canton of Basel Urban, which dismissed their claim in May 2011. Another appeal was filed with a Swiss federal court, which dismissed the claim in March 2012 on the grounds the students’ religious freedoms had not been violated. In April 2012, the parents filed an application with the ECHR, whose decisions are legally binding, arguing the school’s decision violated their rights under Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which protects religious freedoms except in cases that “are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society. ” The   ECHR, unlike previous courts, acknowledged that the students’ case did constitute a religious issue and that the school’s decision caused an “interference” with their freedom to practice their faith. But it also acknowledged the school’s decision was not aimed not at violating the students’ faith, but “to protect foreign pupils from any form of social exclusion. ” In the end, the court decided that the latter took precedence over the former, ruling that the school’s decision, paired with the flexible arrangements it proposed for the girls, did not constitute a religious violation. Here’s more from the ruling: The children’s interest in a full education, facilitating their successful social integration according to local customs and mores, took precedence over the parents’ wish to have their daughters exempted from mixed swimming lessons and that the children’s interest in attending swimming lessons was not just to learn to swim, but above all to take part in that activity with all the other pupils, with no exception on account of the children’s origin or their parents’ religious or philosophical convictions. The parents have three months to appeal the decision to the ECHR’s Grand Chamber. This isn’t the first time the court has favored integration over religious freedom. In a July 2014 case concerning a French Muslim woman’s right to wear the burqa —   a full body covering that has been banned in France since 2011 —   the court ruled that though the proscription acted as a “continuing interference” of the woman’s right to privacy and religious freedom, it did not constitute a violation of her rights and was necessary to ensure that French citizens are a “living together” in society. Erik Bleich, a professor of political science at Middlebury College, told me that there are key differences between these two cases —   notably,  Switzerland’s willingness to reach a compromise. “This isn’t a case of Switzerland bringing the hammer down on adults,” Bleich said. “I read Switzerland in this case as saying, we’re trying to be flexible, we’re trying our best to offer separate changing rooms, the opportunity to wear a burkini.   …     The parents, in this case, are saying we don’t want to be flexible and we’re going to pursue this to the highest judicial appeals level that we can. ” Janina Rashidi, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Central Council of Switzerland (ICCS) told me that though the ICCS, which did not play a formal role in the proceedings, accepts the court’s decision so long as students have the option to wear more conservative swimwear, the ruling still demonstrates a form of intolerance against the Muslim community. “It is not clear how going to swimming class once a month will support integration in a way that makes it more important than the religious beliefs of the girls,” Rashidi said. She added: “In parts of Switzerland, as well as in Basel, it is possible to homeschool children. Nobody would claim that these children face a lack of integration even though they are not schooled with classmates at all. ” This isn’t the first time Muslim students have faced fines for not participating in parts of the Swiss education system deemed to violate their religious beliefs. In September, a local school council in the Swiss town of Therwil, in Basel canton, said two male Muslim students could face a $5, 000 fine and disciplinary action for refusing to shake their female teacher’s hand. A handshake between teachers and students at the beginning and end of each school day is considered a Swiss tradition —  one which the students said violated their religious beliefs. Though the boys originally reached a compromise with the school district, agreeing not to shake any teacher’s hand, regardless of gender, in order to maintain neutrality, regional education authorities overruled the agreement and insisted the tradition be maintained. The reaction by the Muslim community was mixed. Montassar Ben Mrad, the president of Federation of Islamic Organizations in Switzerland, told the Washington Post the tradition was in alignment with Islamic teachings, noting: “Can the denial of shaking hands be more important than the Islamic commandment of mutual respect?” ICCS, however, said the reaction to the boys’ refusal was overblown. “Things which have not been a problem are made up as a problem relating to integration,” Rashidi told me. “[The boys] found a solution that shows respect to their teachers, male and female, without having to be forced to have physical contact, which is against their beliefs. They have never been unintegrated and have always shown respect, as pupils should. ” The issue of integration in Swiss society, in which Muslims make up nearly 5 percent of the   strong population, has extended beyond the school system. In 2009, Swiss voters passed a referendum banning the construction of minarets from the top of mosques, where Muslims traditionally issue the call to prayer —  a move Swiss Justice Minister Eveline   said “reflects fears among the population of Islamic fundamentalist tendencies,” but cautioned, “is not a feasible means of countering extremist tendencies. ” In 2015, the Swiss canton of Ticino issued a burqa ban paired with a fine of up to nearly $10, 000 for violations —  a penalty considerably higher than countries with similar bans such as France (where the fine is $205) and Belgium ($197). Indeed, the issue of integration has extended beyond Switzerland. Throughout Europe, the issue of assimilation of the region’s Muslim population has been the subject of contentious debate —  ranging from the right of Muslim women to wear   veils, or burqas, in public, to the permissibility of Muslim women wearing swimsuits of their choosing on French beaches. Calls to issue a burqa ban in Germany have been renewed and has gained support by politicians, like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who previously opposed such a ban —  a debate that could reemerge during the country’s elections in fall 2017. “A lot of politicians are realizing they can make some hay by claiming that it’s really only the immigrants and only the Muslims that should be bending,” Bleich, the Middlebury professor, told me. “That’s where the inflexibility tends to come in, with   politicians saying, ‘we’re tired of bending   …     they came here and it’s their job to change, not our job to change. ’” Rashidi told me such proscriptions hamper integration rather than encourage it.   “To force Muslims, Jews, or other groups to let go of their religious convictions doesn’t lead to integration and to a feeling of being part of society,” Rashidi said. “[It leads] to the feeling of being misfits, of being not accepted the way they are. ” But when it comes to successful integration, Bleich says it requires effort by both parties. “On a philosophical level, it’s got to be a   street,” Bleich said. “The immigrants that come have to be flexible and willing to adapt to the rules and norms of the host society. But the host society must also be willing, within reason, to be flexible and adapt to the needs and identities of the immigrants. ”"
53322,73505,Resistance to the Antibiotic of Last Resort Is Silently Spreading,Atlantic,Sarah Zhang,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"The alarm bells sounded on November 18, 2015. Antibiotic resistance is usually a   crisis, one of the reasons its danger can be hard to convey. One by one, over the years, the drugs used to fight the most stubborn infections have fallen by the wayside as bacteria have evolved resistance to them. For certain infections, the only drug left is colistin. Then on November 18, 2015, scientists published a report in the British medical journal The Lancet: A single, easily spreadable gene makes the bacteria that carry it resistant to colistin, our antibiotic of last resort. Chinese scientists had found this gene, called   in pig farms and on meat in supermarkets. Why pigs? Herein lies in the irony. Colistin is an old drug and, by modern standards, not a great one. It can cause severe kidney damage. As scientists developed better antibiotics over the decades, colistin fell out of human use. So in China, farmers started using it by the tons in animals, where low doses of antibiotics can promote growth. Now it’s come full circle. Bacteria have evolved resistance to so many of those “better” antibiotics that colistin is critical for human health again. China didn’t use colistin in humans, but many countries including the U. S. do as a last resort. Even more worrisome in the Lancet report was evidence that   had already leapt from pigs to humans. Out of 1322 patient samples from hospitals in China, the team found 16 containing   . And, of course,   bacteria don’t respect national borders. As the team was writing up its report, it noticed other researchers had uploaded genomes of bacteria in Malaysia containing the   gene sequence to an online database. “The possibility that    E. coli have spread outside China and into other countries in southeastern Asia is deeply concerning,” the authors warned. To be clear, these E. coli with   found in China were still susceptible to antibiotics other than colistin, but if a bacterium with genes that make it resistant to every other drug then picks up   you get the nightmare scenario: a   bacteria. These   resistant infections usually happen in people who are already sick or have weakened immune systems. The Lancet  report immediately kicked off a flurry of activity in microbiology labs around the world. And soon enough, the reports started coming out. In December, scientists reported finding   in Denmark. Then Germany and Vietnam and  Spain and  United States and on and on. It seems like every month is a new   development, I said to James Spencer, a microbiologist University of Bristol who collaborated with the Chinese scientists on the original Lancet paper. “Every week,” he corrected me. By the time anyone had figured out  ’s existence, it had already spread around the world.   The story of  ’s silent spread is, by now, a familiar one. Over and over, scientists have identified genes conferring resistance to a class of antibiotics, only to find the gene had circled the globe. Another recent example is   a gene found in 2009 that confers resistance to class of antibiotics called carbapenems. “It’s very rare to catch something at the very beginning,” says Alexander Kallen, a medical epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Looking for resistance is a constant game of  . You don’t notice anything until there is something to notice by the time there is something to notice, something bad has already happened. And you have to have eyes everywhere: Resistance initially found on a Chinese pig farm could repercussions all over the world. When Timothy Walsh, a microbiologist at Cardiff University first heard of  ’s existence from his colleague Yang Wang of China AgriculturalUniversity, he didn’t believe it. “It’s like the holy grail of resistance,” says Walsh. He was also skeptical because of the way colistin works. The antibiotic binds to molecules on the surface of bacteria —  and modifying those molecules typically requires mutations in several different genes. Instead of getting lucky just once, that bacteria would have to get lucky several times to beat off colistin. In fact, other researchers had identified   bacteria before, which had multiple mutations in the DNA in their chromosomes. But   was just one gene. And more importantly, it didn’t live on chromosomes, which are tightly wound pieces of DNA. The   gene sits on a little loop of   DNA called a plasmid, which bacteria —  even bacteria of different species —  can easily swap like bracelets. That makes   much easier to spread. A single bacteria might collect multiple plasmids with multiple genes for resistance to multiple antibiotics. Scientist have not yet found bacteria with   that is resistant to all antibiotics, but don’t make the mistake of optimism. “It’s not a case of ‘if.’ It’s a case of ‘when,’” says Walsh. Meanwhile, the detailed work of understanding   is inching along. In just over a year, scientists have published nearly 150 papers on  . Spencer and Walsh —   along with three other groups based in the U. S. and China —  have each published recent papers looking at the protein that   makes. It appears to be a protein sticks out of the bacteria’s surface, and it has the ability to modify other surface molecules. It seems to need zinc to properly function. But a lot is still unknown. Walsh is now also collaborating on studies in China, Vietnam, and Thailand looking to see how widespread   is among bacteria in the environment —  outside of the just pig farms, supermarkets, and hospitals. They’re looking at bacterial samples from migratory birds and dogs and the gut microbiota of healthy humans.  Whenever animals or people migrate, bacteria migrate. “What actually may occur in the U. S. U. K. Africa, or China, invariably becomes all our problems,” says Walsh.  "
53323,73506,How to Train a Worker,Atlantic,Derek Thompson,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"People sometimes talk about education as though it’s something that ends. High schools, colleges, grad schools: They commence, they conclude, and then you just work. But in an economy in which automation and globalization are rapidly changing and even eliminating certain jobs, American workers and companies might come to see education not as a   but as a way of living. The need for ongoing education is clear from the recent experience of America’s manufacturing sector. Between 2000 and 2008, industrial production grew by 12 percent while the number of U. S. manufacturing jobs declined by more than 3 million. Many of these lost jobs were concentrated in Rust Belt areas that swung heavily toward Donald Trump. When The Atlantic’s Alana Semuels investigated ways for Democrats to help the Rust Belt economy, she reported that almost every economist she spoke with mentioned the same thing: worker training program. But as Semuels pointed out, there’s just one problem with   retraining programs. They don’t really work. Workers are reluctant to attend them for fear that they’re crummy (a reasonable estimation, given the research) or else that there won’t be suitable jobs once they’ve finished the program. For this reason, the best training might be    like the   apprenticeships in Germany. U. S. companies have resisted   training programs so far, since they’re expensive, unproven, and risky for the firm, as Americans switch jobs often and can take their training to another company. The U. S. government has the money to retrain workers, but not the curriculum. Companies have the expertise to teach relevant skills, but won’t spend the money. So why not bring them together to create a   corporate retraining program, one in which Washington pays companies for only those curricula that raise workers’ wages? That’s the gist of a proposal, ”Toward a New Capitalism,” from the Aspen Institute’s Future of Work Initiative, which was   by Senator Mark Warner and former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels. It is called “pay for performance. ” Here’s the idea in a nutshell. A young worker comes to Derek’s Factory to make freezers. After a year, I decide freezers are a terrible business, so I spend a couple thousand dollars training the young worker to make dishwashers. If she’s great at it, and her wages rise, the government will pay back Derek’s Factory a certain portion of my training cost. And what if the young worker leaves for Goldberg’s Factory? Doesn’t matter. I still get the same compensation from the government. There’s a slightly different way to think about this idea. It’s not just a retraining policy. It’s an investment policy. By training workers, businesses are essentially buying a small equity stake in their future wages. If their wages rise, the company gets money, while the worker gives up nothing, purely benefiting from the training program. “We have done a really crummy job to help people who are dislocated by trade,” Senator Warner told me. “We’ve struggled to retrain them with government programs. This is an experiment that could work. ” What would be some of the negative implications of this idea? It’s possible that government compensation still wouldn’t be enough to encourage   companies to train workers, who could simply automate or offshore their labor. The opposite concern is that the government might end up handing out too much money to rich companies whose “training” was going to happen anyway. But there are some ways to address this, like restricting the policy to   compensated workers. Since the “recoup rate” is only a fraction of the training investment, it’s not like companies like Apple could hack a federal retraining program to become a   at the expense of taxpayers. The larger potential objection is that “pay for performance” and other policies in the Aspen Institute paper aren’t dramatic enough to make a different. Other proposals include raising the cap on   education assistance and reforming occupational licensing. According to Senator Warner, this   is partly by design. “I’ve talked to a lot of people about AI and automation and all those changes that are 15 years out,”he said. “But what do we do in the next five years to buy us some time, so that people feel like they have a shot?” In the presidential election, the most famous proposals were gargantuan in their scale and dramatic appeal (build the wall! make college free! etc. ). The Aspen paper represents an different ethos, a philosophy of tweaks that is perhaps more aligned with the reality of  . Politicians promise political revolution as if it might fall from the sky, like a spaceship,  . But most policy is a boring of hard boards, an assembly of little parts built from the ground up."
53324,73507,The Revolt of Working Parents,Atlantic,Alexia Fernández Campbell,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"“There is no way you can be a good mother while achieving what I aspire.” “Let’s face it. It’s a man’s world. The woman always stays home with the child. ” “It’s hard to do this job with two kids. ” These are just a few phrases working mothers reported hearing from their supervisors when discussing promotions or demotions, according to recent court filings. The subtle —  and sometimes overt —  perception illustrated by these statements —  that mothers are less devoted to their jobs than childless workers —  has been dubbed “the Maternal Wall” or “the New Glass Ceiling. ” This has led to a wave of claims of gender discrimination based on parental responsibilities, which now make up a growing number of lawsuits against American employers. In the past decade, the number of   lawsuits has tripled compared to the previous decade, according to research from the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, San Francisco. Between 2006 and 2015, researchers found that more than 3, 000 such cases were decided in state and federal courts, even as overall federal   claims were declining. This growing number of lawsuits includes claims from mothers, fathers and those who take care of ill or disabled relatives. These aren’t baseless lawsuits either, as more than half have led to compensation for victims —  a    success rate for   claims. In a major   lawsuit filed last summer, seven   female employees of the software developer, Qualcomm, sued the company on behalf of more than 3, 000 female workers for gender discrimination, including motherhood discrimination. The women claimed that they were repeatedly passed over for advancement in favor of   male employees. They believe this explains why women make up only 5 percent of senior management positions at the San   tech firm, and only 5 percent of top engineering positions. “Qualcomm maintains an unwritten policy of disparately rewarding employees who work late into the night over employees who choose to arrive early and leave at the end of a normal  . This policy disparately impacts and causes the Company to undervalue caregivers of   children . .. These common policies stigmatize employees with caregiving responsibilities and disproportionately penalize women,” they wrote in their complaint. One of the plaintiffs, a   market analyst and working mother, said that she was passed over for promotions in favor of substantially   male workers despite her outstanding performance reviews. One top engineer with three   children said she began receiving negative evaluations and fewer promotions compared to   male peers after she asked to scale back her work schedule to 30 hours per week to take care of her children —  even though she says she was just as productive as before. The same month that employees filed the lawsuit, Qualcomm agreed to settle the case for $23. 5 million. Of that payout, $19. 5 million will be paid to the female employees, and the company agreed to spend another $4 million to ensure equal opportunities for women at Qualcomm. “While we have strong defenses to the claims, we elected to focus on continuing to make meaningful enhancements to our internal programs and processes that drive equity and a diverse and inclusive workforce,” a spokesperson from Qualcomm said in a statement. Cynthia Calvert, a senior advisor at the WorkLife Center, says that caregiver discrimination is one of the   areas of employment law. “Employers haven’t realized that discrimination against motherhood or fatherhood can be gender discrimination,” she says. It’s particularly insidious in supervisors’ biases about gender roles. With women, she says, a common scenario involves overlooking female employees for  challenging assignments because employers assume mothers won’t want to travel or handle the extra workload. “With men, they are punished because they want to work more flexibly to take care of a child, and the employer thinks they’re not acting the way men are supposed to act,” says Calvert, who has analyzed thousands of   cases. While claims filed by fathers are fewer than those filed by working mothers and pregnant women, Calvert says the number of male plaintiffs has increased sharply in the past decade. Under federal law, it’s not explicitly illegal for employers to discriminate against working parents, though employees have succeeded in showing that it can be deemed unlawful sex discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits job discrimination based on religion, race, sex, and national origin. Several states and the District of Columbia have gone farther than federal laws by making it illegal to punish workers who need accommodations for caregiving responsibilities. Last year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed such a law, which went beyond protecting pregnant women and parents, to include all people who provide care for relatives, such as grandparents and those who look after their disabled parents. The problem of caretaker discrimination is costing companies a lot of money. In the past decade, employees were awarded nearly half a billion dollars in verdicts and settlements, according to the WorkLife Center’s report. That is more than double the amount awarded the decade before. And these numbers do not include confidential settlement agreements, which means that the total cost is likely higher. The trend reflects the shifting gender roles in American families and workplaces. In 1960, about 25 percent of household with children had both parents working, by 2012 that had jumped to 60 percent. Calvert says that companies are starting to pay more attention to potential parental discrimination, and she believes preventative training around the issue will one day become normal. She points out that though it seems commonplace now, it took American businesses many years to understand that sexual harassment in the workplace was illegal gender discrimination. Things started to change when lawsuits began affecting the bottom line, and now   videos and employee handbooks outlining illegal sexual harassment are the norm. If the courts keep siding with working parents, American companies may have to take notice."
53325,73508,The Perfectly Normal Ways Trump Can Enrich Himself as President,Atlantic,James Kwak,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Along with the many unprecedented problems they create, Donald Trump’s conflicts of interest, as with so many other things, illustrate in striking fashion an existing flaw in American democracy. The problem is corruption: the potential for elected officials to take actions that benefit themselves, their family, their friends, or their business associates rather than the country as a whole. Donald Trump’s   licensing, and entertainment empire throws the problem into stark relief. Foreign leaders could give Trump’s businesses abroad sweetheart deals in order to curry favor with the leader of the free world. (The latest plan is for the Trump Organization to donate to the U. S. government “profits” from transactions with foreign states, but that’s only a minimal constraint.) Domestically, any number of government policies —  the minimum wage, overtime rules, and so on —  could be designed to benefit the Trump Organization. Putting the Trump Organization in a trust is hardly even a fig leaf, since the beneficiary of the trust would most likely be the president’s children (or Trump himself) and he would still have an interest in doing favors for his family. Even if his company were placed in a blind trust, the   would retain the knowledge he already has of his assets, and could see which assets were sold and which were still part of his holdings. Selling off the businesses now, even at   prices, would be a better solution. But it is naive to think that doing so would completely eradicate his conflicts of interest. History shows that corruption rarely comes in black and white it thrives on shades of gray. Did Halliburton get a   dollar,   contract to operate Iraqi oil wells because it was the best deal the government could get, or because Vice President Dick Cheney wanted to help the company he had led for five years, and in which he still held stock options? Hank Paulson placed his assets in a blind trust when he became treasury secretary —  but was that enough to make him truly disinterested in the fate of Goldman Sachs, the bank where he had worked for more than 30 years, during the financial crisis of 2008? Sophisticated investors even seem to expect that powerful officials will favor companies with which they have relationships: According to research by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, Amir Kermani, Todd Mitton, and me, financial institutions with connections to Tim Geithner enjoyed extraordinary   gains when he was nominated to be treasury secretary in November 2008. The potential to use public power to further private interests goes far beyond a president cutting a good deal for his own company. In fact, the single biggest thing Donald Trump could do to enrich his family is something that has nothing to do with his business interests: repealing the estate tax. Though Trump has never disclosed his precise net worth —  Forbes puts it at $3. 7 billion —  his family stands to lose 40 percent of it to the estate tax. Put another way, eliminating the tax would increase his family’s   wealth by   —  more than $1 billion, based on the estimate from Forbes. It’s hard to imagine anything the   could do that would increase the value of his businesses by that much.   Trump will be able to boost his family’s wealth without the slightest hint of impropriety, because   repeal has been a Republican Party priority for years. But why is getting rid of a tax that affects only the richest 0. 2 percent of families at the top of the Republican majority’s   list? Because, as the political scientists Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page have shown, our political system responds to the preferences of the very wealthy, not those of ordinary people. Of course, proponents wouldn’t describe repealing the estate tax as a giveaway to the very rich. Instead, from   Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan on down, they argue that, because it only affects money a person doesn’t use during his or her lifetime, the estate tax discourages savings, so repealing it will increase savings and investment, turbocharging economic growth. Economists who have surveyed the recent research, such as Eric Toder and Kim Rueben at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and Jane Gravelle and Donald Marples at the Congressional Research Service, however, find that the evidence for this theoretical proposition is flimsy at best. This type of naive or disingenuous belief that the world operates according to the dictates of Economics 101 serves to disguise the interests of wealthy politicians and their even wealthier donors as sound economic policy. (And   repeal is only the tip of the iceberg. According to research by the Tax Policy Center, eliminating the estate tax would cost $174 billion over the next 10 years Trump’s proposed 15 percent tax on corporations and other businesses is worth $3. 2 trillion.) None of this is to say that wealthy individuals are incapable of pursuing economic policies that benefit the public good indeed, many have, historically. But the opportunity for   is real, and it requires leaders who are committed to differentiating between the public’s interests and those of their donors —  or themselves. It would be an important step toward resolving the  ’s conflicts of interest if he were to sell his businesses. But the prospect of a company owned by a sitting president is only the most naked manifestation of the “rigged” system against which Trump himself campaigned. Ultimately, the benefits the   could extract for his own   company are dwarfed by the favors that the new administration can do for its core constituency of billionaires and   —  including Trump himself."
53326,73509,The Hermit Who Inadvertently Shaped Climate-Change Science,Atlantic,J. Weston Phippen,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"It was a year into his life alone in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains when Billy Barr began his recordings. It started as a curiosity, a task to busy his mind during the winter. By no means, Barr told me, having skied down from his cabin to use the nearest phone, did he set out to make a vital database for climate change scientists. “Hell no!” he said. “I didn’t know anything about climate change at the time. ” In 1973 Barr had dropped out of college and made his home an abandoned mining shack at the base of Gothic Mountain, a   stone buttress. The cold winds blew through the shack’s wood slat walls as if they didn’t exist. He shared the shack’s bare dirt floor with a skunk and pine marten, his only regular company for much of the year. Barr had moved from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains precisely because of the solitude, but he couldn’t escape boredom. Especially that first winter. So he measured snow levels, animal tracks, and in spring the first jubilant calls of birds returning. He filled a notebook with these observations then another notebook. This has continued now for 44 years. Barr’s data would likely have remained the tinkerings of an amateur scientist were he not so close to the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) one of the most important phenology research sites in the world. During the last couple decades, scientists at the RMBL have become fascinated with climate change’s impact on plants and animals in the high alpines, hoping to scale their discoveries into broader lessons about life in a warmer earth. But their research suffered from a dearth of   records. In Gothic, for example, the spring snow seemed to melt a little earlier. The flowers blossomed a little sooner. But without historical context, these little changes could not be understood for what they really were. The site of the RMBL was once a silver boomtown in the 1880s, but within a decade it’d been abandoned for richer mines elsewhere. In 1928, a biology professor rediscovered the area and founded what is now a summer pilgrimage of scientists. Researchers at the lab sleep in cabins and university department presidents and lowly students share mess hall tables, working    on   conservation studies. One of the lab’s   studies is a wildflower research project started by ecologist David Inouye. The same year Barr would become Gothic’s only permanent resident, in 1973, Inouye measured some 30 plots to study wildflowers. By recording when and how long flowers bloomed Inouye and a handful of scientist hoped to draw correlations to the insects and birds that feed upon them. This research has since been used in many studies and is particularly important to understanding how climate change alters flower blooming times, the animals that depend on them, and thus the rest of Gothic Mountain’s ecology. And by extension, to high alpine environments everywhere. The idea for the study arose out of a casual conversation, and that is part of RMBL’s beauty. A similar beautiful fluke would lead Inouye to discover Barr’s 40 years of data. Barr had intended to spend one summer in Gothic as a research student. In 1972 he was 21 years old, a shy, skinny guy studying environmental science at Rutgers University. The summer before he’d shoveled shit and hay at a dairy farm and he was ready for a change. The field of conservation was still small back then, so even though he had little experience, when he saw the RMBL was looking for help with a water chemistry project, Barr applied. One of the first newspaper interviews Barr gave —  long after he’d become known in the nearby town as the eccentric mountain man —  romanticized his escape to Gothic, painting him as Thoreauvian. “He climbed to a nearby mountain peak the day he made that decision and sat in the waning daylight  …     ” The reality is that he couldn’t hack the regular world.  “I was just getting more and more depressed,” Barr, now 66 years old, told me. “A lot of me moving out there the first few years was just me stabilizing getting to be around quiet. ” Gothic is about 10 miles from the nearest town. In the winter the road is closed and it’s unreachable except by backcountry skis on a trail that cuts through dangerous avalanche territory. His first winter, Barr lived in a tent as long as he could bear. When snow piled up he moved into the abandoned     mining shack. It had a   stove and a bed, but its true value lay in its messy chain of title. The RMBL seemed to think the cabin belonged to the U. S. Forest Service. And the Forest Service thought it belonged to the RMBL. A local man also claimed to own it, so amid this triangle of confusion Barr found a home. Barr seemed to spend all day that first winter chopping wood. He’d wake before sunrise, eat, ski into the woods, cut down a dead tree, eat, haul it back, then split the logs for a fire. In the hope that it would keep him busy at night, and thinking that it might come in handy next winter, he began to track the snow levels and the wildlife on his treks into the woods. “Under kerosene light you can’t do much,” Barr told me. “And after a few years I had something to compare each winter with. ” In the summer he took odd jobs, working on a hotshot crew fighting wildfires, and later washing dishes in the RMBL’s kitchen. Each year, the RMBL seemed to operate on a prayer. No one tracked the bills, and the distracted scientists came and left without much thought for the lab’s upkeep. In the late 1970s Barr became the unofficial caretaker, shutting off the water so the pipes wouldn’t freeze, keeping an eye on the research equipment. In return the lab let him borrow its car parked at the bottom of the mountain so he could drive into town for supplies. Barr always considered himself a numbers guy, and as a kid growing up in Trenton, New Jersey, he kept detailed baseball stats on his favorite players. When the RMBL’s   found out, he suggested Barr take an accounting class through the mail. In the early 1980s Barr became the lab’s accountant. Around this same time Barr built his own home a half mile from the lab. He added solar panels and a greenhouse for vegetables, and a theater room with a projector to watch his favorite Bollywood films. With age he grew more relaxed around people. One year he skied into town to see a play at the local theater, and when he arrived he was the only person in the audience. The play’s director wanted to call it off. But when everyone realized it was Barr seated there —  his long beard and   body —  they put on the play anyway. As the RMBL’s accountant, Barr became the first person researchers saw as they checked in —  as well the primary source of chocolate candy —  and in that way he became the lab’s face. All the while he kept his records. Each stenographer’s notebook lasted for three years of data, and Barr developed his own code. In the morning and night he logged snow levels, weather, and temperatures. For wildlife he invented his own number system, and in red he circled first sightings: the mammals emerging from hibernation, or the first calls for spring from the robins, the flickers, and especially important to Inouye would be the   hummingbird. Having lived in the area nearly three decades, Barr had become good friends with many of the scientist, and because Inouye had visited RMBL as long as Barr had lived there, the two talked often in the summer. Even so, it wasn’t until the late 1990s that Inouye learned of Barr’s priceless trove of data. It happened during a conversation no one clearly recalls. By the end of it, Barr agreed to send Inouye some of the his research. “I realized right away what a valuable treasure it was,” Inouye told me of the moment he saw Barr’s work. “I knew what type of thing could be done with access to historical records. ” Barr’s notes have now appeared in dozens of research papers focused on climate change science. His notebooks on the first and last snow, the snowpack levels in between, and when hibernating animals wake and when the birds return to the the high alpine environment have provided an unexpected glimpse back into a world scientists never recorded. And from the past, scientists have gained a little more understanding of the the world’s warming future. Hydrologists like Rosemary Carroll, who works at the Desert Research Institute, use Barr’s snowpack data and other sources to model groundwater flows to the Colorado River. Forty million people rely on the river to pipe water to their faucets, and Carroll’s work —  with the help of Barr’s data —  will help shape water policy for Southwestern cities. Inouye has included Barr’s records in several studies, and collectively his work has become some of the most significant indication that climate change is rearranging mountain ecosystems more dramatically and quickly than anyone imagined. In his work with wildflowers Inouye understood that first flowering came about a month earlier now than when he’d begun the project 40 years ago. He also understood that the male   hummingbird’s wings make a whistling sound, and indeed Barr had tracked the bird’s return each spring. Together with Barr’s weather and snow melt, Inouye was able to show how climate change’s impact on a single flower might mean the end of   hummingbird migration in the region. The hummingbird relies on nectar from the glacier lily —  so much so that it synced its migration to arrive in Gothic just before it blooms. To adjust to warmer springs, however, the lily now flowers 17 days earlier than it did four decades ago. In two more decades it’s likely the   hummingbird will completely miss the glacier lily’s nectar. This widening seasonal imbalance is called phenological mismatch, and has become a major concern as scientists learn more about climate change. In Gothic, this will impact not just   hummingbirds, but also butterflies, bees, hibernating mammals, and the animals that depend on all those animals. These same dynamics will play out across the Rocky Mountains, and similar alpine ecosystems across the world. Barr still wakes each day in his cabin before dawn to log the snow levels. He buys his wood now, which has freed up some time, and he has started the dreary process of converting his notebooks into spreadsheets. Sometimes Barr is credited as a contributor on reports that use his data sometimes not. This year, however, he’s won some much deserved recognition. He is a character in a    documentary called End of Snow and this summer the RMBL named a building after him: The Billy Barr Community Center. “Some day I’ll die,” Barr said, and people will ask: “Who the hell is it named after —  this Billy Barr?”"
53327,73510,"Trump Thanks L.L. Bean, the Latest Retailer Caught Between Him and His Critics",Atlantic,Adam Chandler,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Updated January 12 at 9:50 a. m. On Thursday morning,   Donald Trump tweeted out a cryptic note of solidarity with L. L. Bean, the     retailer. Thank you to Linda Bean of L. L. Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L. L. Bean. @LBPerfectMaine, Trump was referencing a furor that had ignited after reports from the Associated Press last week revealed that Linda Bean, the granddaughter of the company’s founder and one of L. L. Bean’s 10 board members, made a $60, 000 donation to a   PAC that had far exceeded the legal limit. The company had come under fire, not because of the size of the contribution, but the fact that she had given to Trump at all. The story quickly caught the attention of #GrabYourWallet, a        movement, which urges American shoppers against patronizing companies with business or political links to   Donald Trump. Linda Bean’s donation had placed the company in the #GrabYourWallet crosshairs and its acolytes took to excoriating the company across Twitter and Facebook. Here is the link to unsubscribe from @LLBean forever https:  .  #grabyourwallet #dumptrump,  No money will be spent at L. L. Bean. Not by me, my family, or my friends. Ever. #GrabYourWallet https:  .  The phrase #GrabYourWallet was chosen back in October as a    reference to the   leaked Access Hollywood tapes, which featured Trump and Billy Bush engaged in violent and misogynistic banter about grabbing women’s genitalia in 2005. “I was looking for a way to be effective in my response to the Trump tapes,” said Shannon Coulter, a San   marketing strategist and   of the initiative. “I was musing about it one night after some online shopping at Nordstrom and saying, ‘I kind of feel ambivalent about the fact that Nordstrom —  this company that I love —  carries Trump products and does business with the Trump family. ” Coulter aired her hashtagged discontent and it spread across Twitter. Soon, she was united with Sue Atencio, whom she met on the platform, and the two created an online spreadsheet with the names of the retailers peddling   merchandise —  including Ivanka Trump’s various fashion lines —  as well as companies with executives who have made donations to the Trump campaign. There are gradations of perceived offense in the #GrabYourWallet database. Selling Trump materiel, as Sear’s and Amazon do, earns a call for outright boycott. Those brands with executives who have offered financial contributions or rhetorical support of Trump’s candidacy or businesses —  such as Bean or Brian France of NASCAR —  fall into a slightly more forgiving “consider boycotting” section. “I am more conservative about adding companies to the list based on the political activities of their leaders versus a company having a direct business relationship with the Trump family and profiting directly from selling Trump products,” explains Coulter. Historically,   campaigns driven by social media tend to produce little in terms of concrete results, as evidenced by  #Kony2012 or #BringBackOurGirls. At least some of this has to do with the fact that these campaigns have rarely spurred actionable next steps outside the digital realm. Boycotts, however, are a little bit different. Though their tangible impact on a company or entity is rarely perceptible, all the negative attention does have an effect. In a recent study detailed by The New Yorker’s James Surowiecki this week, Brayden King, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, found that while major boycotts held between 1990 and 2005 failed to significantly dampen sales, the bad publicity did affect company stock. Accordingly, more than a third of the targeted businesses changed course in response to protests. Naturally, the inexorable ubiquity of social media combined with greater access to information about companies has made mobilizing the masses not only easier than it used to be, but also a more attractive way of harnessing outrage. “Increasingly, the way we express our political opinions is through buying or not buying instead of voting or not voting,” Michael Norton, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, told me. “It turns out the reasons that people don’t buy products are often pretty much the same as the reasons they do: When we buy products, we’re looking to express an identity that’s important to us, we’re looking to fit in with other people who we like, and we’re also looking to stand out from other people at the same time. ..I think when we boycott, we’re doing the same thing. ” According to Coulter, six companies have been removed  from the #GrabYourWallet boycott list, some (such as Shoes. com) were removed after they corresponded with #GrabYourWallet and vowed to remove   wares from their stores. Other retailers simply stopped selling   products without publicly declaring a reason —  so the group took them off the list, too. That the chairman of L. L. Bean   #GrabYourWallet in his appeal rather than simply referencing an amorphous boycott seems like a testament to the group’s reach. Coulter adds that The Honest Company, a   “ethical consumerism” brand founded by the actress Jessica Alba, is the next company slated for removal from the  boycott list. The company was added after the public learned of a scheduled appearance on the   Celebrity Apprentice next month. “They got in touch recently to say they won’t be a sponsor of Celebrity Apprentice anymore if there are future seasons of the show,” she says. Another feature that distinguishes #GrabYourWallet is their promotion of  alternative retailers. This list offers a collection of brands that either don’t sell   apparel or that have  spoken out against Trump’s statements or proposed policies. As it turns out, this is a crucial component in the life of a boycott. “There’s some research that shows that one of the key predictors of boycotts is actually the availability of substitutes,” Norton explains. “It’s as though you will strongly express your political opinions as long as there is a comparable brand that you can buy instead. ” Norton suggests that the boycott of a hamburger company, for example,  would almost certainly fail unless there was another hamburger company nearby. “Certainly some people have strong beliefs and they’ll boycott no matter what,” he adds. “But the marginal consumer, like most things in life, will do it if it’s easy enough to do it. If it becomes difficult in terms of a substitute or the price of a competitor is too high, then we’ll ignore our political beliefs a little and continue to purchase. ” Of course, the ethical dimensions of retail boycotts don’t drop neatly along partisan lines. Take Macy’s, for example, which has come under censure not only by #GrabYourWallet for selling Ivanka Trump apparel, but by the   himself. Following comments Trump made about immigrants in the summer of 2015, Macy’s dropped his signature line of clothing from its racks, a move that inspired Trump to call for a boycott. I hope the boycott of @Macys continues forever. So many people are cutting up their cards. Macy’s stores suck and they are bad for U. S. A. Coulter says that she can see that Macy’s has found itself in a difficult position, failing to please either side. But in some ways, she argues, it’s a situation of their own making. “They’ve actually said on the record that they don’t want to be a ‘politically associated company,’” Coulter says. “As Ivanka Trump’s political role has deepened considerably, I think the disparity between the talk and the walk has become more apparent to people. ” Last week, following a poor   showing, Macy’s announced it would be cutting over 10, 000 jobs and identified 68 stores that it would close in the coming months. Trump, normally a   Twitter warrior, has yet to declare his victory over Macy’s. But while #GrabYourWallet has demonstrated the ability to create some change, it’s also possible that supporters of Trump, or brand fanatics will try to swoop in to make up for losses incurred by boycotters. Trump’s tweet on Thursday morning already seems to aiding the cause. Back on the L. L. Bean Facebook page, thousands of the brand’s defenders are already pledging their support."

Government Watchers: Yesterday, with just a week left before Trump’s inauguration, the Obama administration finalized a new set of surveillance rules. The changes give the NSA power to share raw data with other U. S. intel groups that apply for access, before a set of required privacy protections are applied. For privacy advocates, the move causes serious concern: By expanding the number of people allowed to see data that’s often collected without warrants, it increases the risk of innocent people’s private info being exposed. On the other hand, according to an expert in   law, these rules have been in the works for as many as 15 years and don’t change the scope of data collected. Indeed, finalizing the rules now may stop the new administration from expanding surveillance powers further. Government Watchdogs: After the head of the Office of Government Ethics denounced as “meaningless” Trump’s plan to address his conflicts of interest, Trump’s allies —  including House Oversight chair Jason Chaffetz —  are harshly criticizing the independent agency. Elsewhere in Congress, Republicans are working to scale back federal oversight of U. S. businesses, arguing that such regulations prevent economic growth. But deregulation has its own risks —  evident, for example, in the Detroit school system, where charter schools have exploded with little accountability for student success, partly thanks to the loopholes in legislation supported by Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos. Government, Watched: This week, the characters of NBC’s   dealt with the aftermath of the U. S. election in an episode that artfully combined the expression of anger with a plea for empathy.

Will Di Novi on a psychologist’s database of dreams about President Obama: In the early dreams, Obama is a figure of messianic powers, resolving disputes, levitating objects, and, in one eerily prophetic dream, ripping off Osama Bin Laden’s fingers with his teeth. Around the time of the 2010 midterms, he begins to succumb to the political crises that the dreamers were following in the news. A    woman from Washington State dreams of a sinister conspiracy involving “GM and the big oil companies,” who are staging the BP Oil Spill to make Obama look bad. A 2011 report shows a    dreamer reacting to the news that his wife “doesn’t think she likes Obama any more. ” Obama continues to struggle in dreams from his second term. He is insulted at social gatherings and shows up to a speech “crippled and in a wheelchair. ” But even as Obama has been worn down by the rigors of the presidency, [researcher Kelly] Bulkeley’s liberal subjects have maintained their fondness for the man behind the institution. They dream of drinking beers with him at parties. They dream of meeting him for lunch dates. As one of Bulkeley’s longtime subjects, an East Coast liberal, puts it in a dream report from 2015: “[Obama] acknowledges my presence in some way. . .. His presence is strong. ” Keep reading here, as Di Novi considers what dreams can reveal about America’s political life. 1.

For me, that meant reading a lot and reporting. I don’t know that white people need to be “allies” so much as understand that any black struggle in America, is ultimately, a struggle for the large country.

53331,73514,What the Investigation Into the Chicago Police Department Found ,Atlantic,Yasmeen Serhan,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"The results of the investigation into the Chicago Police Department’s use of force released Friday by the U. S. Department of Justice shows the city’s police engaged in systemic practices that violated residents’ constitutional rights. Here are some of the key findings from the report, which you can read in full here. The findings come 13 months after the investigation began, and more than two years since the fatal police shooting of    Laquan McDonald, whose death —  which was captured by police   footage and withheld by Chicago authorities for more than a year —  prompted the inquiry. The report’s release comes a month after the city announced that there were 762 were homicides in Chicago in 2016 —  more than Los Angeles and New York combined. Only 29 percent of these cases resulted in police identifying the suspected killer —  a clearance rate less than half of the national average, the report pointed out. Here are some other key findings: Unlawful use of deadly force against individuals who pose no threat, The investigation uncovered numerous incidents of police officers using deadly force against individuals who were unarmed or posed no immediate threat. Some of these incidents, the report notes, were initiated as foot pursuits “without any basis for believing the person had committed a serious crime. ” Unlawful use of    force  In cases where   force, such as tasers, was used, the investigation also uncovered evidence of unlawful or retaliatory conduct, noting that some officers “resort to Tasers as a tool of convenience, with insufficient concern or cognizance that it s a weapon with inherent risks that inflict significant pain. ” Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the department will equip every officer with Tasers, though evidence does not suggest they reduce   shootings. Unlawful use of force in cases of health crises, Though law enforcement is often the first to respond in cases of mental or behavioral health crises, the investigation found that officers use force against people in crisis in cases where force could be avoided. A “meaningful number” of these instances, according to the report, were deemed unconstitutional. Failure to address racially discriminatory behavior  The investigation noted that some police officers disproportionately target minorities, citing statistics that show the department used force against black Chicagoans 10 times more frequently than their white counterparts. The report also noted the routine use of racially discriminatory language targeting blacks and Hispanics. Lack of sufficient officer training  Underlying the systemic issues within the department, the reports finds, is a lack of sufficient training and supervision for the approximately   strong force. This includes the use of outdated and inconsistent materials, as well as insufficient instruction by field training instructors. Lack of accountability, The lack of sufficient training is supplemented by a lack of proper procedures to ensure that officers are held accountable for possible cases of misconduct. In the five years preceding the Justice Department’s investigation, it found that less than 2 percent of 30, 000 police misconduct complaints were sustained, with the remaining 98 percent resulting in no discipline. The report cites a number of systemic factors precluding misconduct investigations, including an unwillingness to investigate anonymous complaints, provisions in union agreements, and officers’ “code of silence” aimed at covering up misconduct. Emanuel called the investigation’s findings “sobering” and pledged to negotiate an agreement with the Justice Department to achieve systemic reforms. It is unclear what impact such an agreement will have in the final days of President Obama’s administration. Jeff Sessions,   Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, voiced concern over police oversight investigations during his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday, testifying that federal lawsuits against local law enforcement could “undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness. ”"
53332,73515,The Transnational Trolley and Doughnuts in Juarez: The Week in Global-Affairs Writing,Atlantic,Anna Diamond,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Is Europe Disintegrating? Timothy Garton Ash | The New York Review of Books“The period of European history after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 might be called, in shorthand, ‘ .’ But then we face a further question: Are we still in that period? Or did the   era end during my imagined cryogenic slumber, sometime between the high point of early 2005 and the low of today? Such bookend dates are always contestable, but it seems plausible to suggest that the financial crisis of 2008 —  2009, which started in the US but rapidly spread to Europe, has initiated a new period characterized by three larger crises: of capitalism, of democracy, and of the project of European integration. ” * * * The Obama Legacy on JihadismRobin Wright | The New Yorker“One of the most memorable moments of the Obama Presidency was his abrupt appearance on nationwide television, shortly before midnight, on Sunday, May 1, 2011. The press pool, which had been given a ‘lid’ to stand down for the night almost six hours earlier, received an   alert from the White House to get positioned for a statement. Many had to scramble to get ready before President Obama walked down the red carpet to a podium set up in the East Room. ‘Tonight,’ he announced, ‘I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda.’ It would prove to be the Obama Administration’s high point in confronting jihadism. The President’s legacy on extremism will be mixed. He leaves the White House with the threat both broader and more diverse than when he took office. During his eight years, jihadis gained far more turf, more followers, more arms, and more money. They have had a deadlier impact and a bigger theatre of operations than they had in 2009 —  even though most of the trends were seeded during the Bush Administration. Obama may never fully recover from his description of the Islamic State, in 2014, to David Remnick, as the ‘jayvee team’ involved in ‘various local power struggles. ’” * * * The Legend of El Paso’s Transnational StreetcarKriston Capps | CityLab“For nearly a century, the international streetcar ferried workers, shoppers, and commuters between El Paso and Juárez. At the height of its service in the 1960s, the line offered more than 500 trips a day. Before the border was fortified by fences and concertina wire, it was notable as the site of the   J. C. Penney department store in the U. S. —  in El Paso, where Mexican nationals shopped every day. While it may be hard to believe now —  what with the U. S.   Donald Trump and the former Mexican President Vicente Fox squaring off over who exactly will pay for Trump’s impossible border wall —  the transnational trolley once unified the conurbation of Paso del Norte. ” * * * With The   Rising, Dutch Create Their Own Parties For ImmigrantsLauren Frayer | NPR“Denk’s candidates include a Muslim woman who wears a headscarf, people of Turkish and Moroccan descent and black people like Simons. All of them say they’ve felt left out of Dutch politics, especially now that the     leader Geert Wilders is surging in the polls. ‘People of color are not recognized as proper Dutch, and there is where the anger is, from people who are seen as   citizens, while they were born here,’ says Sandew Hira, an economist and historian who leads the International Institute for Scientific Research, which studies colonialism and is based in The Hague. ” * * * Putin and Erdogan’s Marriage of ConvenienceHenri J. Barkey | Foreign Policy“These episodes are emblematic of the changing nature of the   relationship. Frustrated by the Syrian opposition’s loss of ground against President Bashar   and fearing the empowerment of the Syrian Kurds, Erdogan began to tack toward Moscow and away from its Western alliance partners roughly a year after Ankara shot down the Russian warplane. Turkey is now one of the parties in the Syrian   negotiations, along with Russia and Iran its equities are the armed Sunni opposition groups that depend on Ankara. By contrast, the United States, Turkey’s traditional ally, was excluded from the negotiations and the pending conference in Astana. Considering that Moscow and Ankara had been at loggerheads since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, with each supporting opposing factions, how did this new result come about? The answer paradoxically lies more in Erdogan’s pique at the United States than anything Putin may have done. ” * * * The ‘Krispy Kreme Familia’ and the Black Market Doughnuts of JuarezKate Linthicum | Los Angeles Times”In Juarez, Garcia, 51, and her two sons are the undisputed kings of the Krispy Kreme black market. Several times a week, one son crosses the border to El Paso and drives to the Krispy Kreme shop there, where the bulk purchase price is about $5 a dozen. He returns to Mexico with around 40 boxes of doughnuts so   that comedian Chris Rock once suggested they might be laced with crack. In Juarez, Garcia and another son sell the doughnuts nightly from two locations for $8 a dozen, or a 60% markup. ”"
53333,73516,The ’Trump Dossier’ and the Making of Intelligence,Atlantic,Kathy Gilsinan,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"There were two   highly sensitive documents circulating in Washington in early January, both relating to Donald Trump and the Russians. The first, a classified report by the U. S. intelligence community, contained evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 United States election, which intelligence officials have publicly concluded was intended to help Trump win the presidency. The second, a   unverified opposition research report compiled by a private intelligence firm, contained explosive personal and financial allegations about the   in some cases allegedly gathered by or in the possession of Russian intelligence.   The Biggest Intelligence Questions Raised by the Trump Dossier, And what has publicly linked these two reports of different genres is two pages. That was the length of an “annex” appended to the classified government document on Russian election hacking, reportedly summarizing some allegations from the other document, the private firm’s dossier on Trump. And it was a news leak about those two pages that precipitated the publication of the full opposition dossier. Though members of the intelligence community had been made aware of the dossier as far back as August 2016, James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, emphasized this week that the dossier was not, itself, “an intelligence community product” —  American intelligence officials had neither produced nor verified the contents of the report, but summarized parts to provide policymakers with the “fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security. ” (Further confusing matters, it appears a former British intelligence official did produce it.) As Stanford’s Amy Zegart notes, all intelligence is information, but not all information is intelligence. So what information qualifies? And how does the intelligence community process or try to verify alleged information like what’s in the Trump dossier? I spoke about these and other questions with Dennis Blair, who was the director of national intelligence, overseeing the intelligence community, in 2010 and 2011. A condensed and edited transcript of our conversation follows. Kathy Gilsinan: What distinguishes the Trump dossier from an intelligence product? Dennis Blair: An intelligence product is written to answer a specific question that’s of interest either to policymakers or to operational leaders in the field, and it generally starts with a particular intelligence requirement: “What will ISIS do next?” at the high end, down to “Where are the IEDs in Aleppo?” on the low end. So the intelligence community doesn’t just wander off and write about what catches its fancy. It’s trying to provide information to help better decisions. On the information that goes into an intelligence report, it’s a combination of intelligence that’s gathered through clandestine means, whether it be signals intelligence, where you copy an email or tap a phone or human intelligence, where you have a spy talking to you or technical intelligence, like a picture that you interpret —  that’s the information that you go out and gather. And you blend that with information that’s available to most any expert in the field —  databases that are put together by academic institutions or businesses in some cases, observations from people in the field who are not intelligence officers, but are knowledgeable observers. It starts with those sources of intelligence, and then it has to come to some sort of an assessment of answering a question: “Here’s where the IEDs are,” “this is what we think ISIS will do. ” So that’s 99 percent of what the intelligence community spends its time doing. But occasionally, just in the course of [their] business, people in the intelligence community run across documents or stories that are just generally   that clearly are going to be of interest to policymakers. And when you find something about the actions of your   that certainly falls squarely in that category. So then you have to make a decision —  generally at a high level in the intelligence community —  as to what you do with it. Gilsinan: So we have this mysterious dossier from a private intelligence company that approaches the FBI in Rome, sometime in August in 2016. Generally speaking, how would the community —  the FBI in this case —  process something like that? Blair: It would be turned into a field report describing how it arrived, and then that context for how it showed up [would be forwarded] along with the document itself or evidence of other kinds, and that would be sent in a field report to the analytical center at headquarters. Something this explosive and this big would be sent at fairly high levels there would be extra precautions taken to make sure that it’s not widely disseminated. It would get to leadership within the FBI and then in the intelligence community pretty quickly. Gilsinan: Suppose I were some guy in Rome in August 2016 and I went to the FBI with some explosive allegations that I had totally made up. Would that reach high levels? How do you know when to take information seriously enough to waste the boss’s time with it, essentially? Blair: That’s a tricky one. You would give [it] an initial screening. If the guy who walked in the door was drooling,   not making sense, and there were a lot of misspellings and typos in the document itself, you’d probably put it in a circular file right away. But if it’s something that has a superficial veracity to it and seems like it might be true, if you’re sitting there as the legal attaché in Rome, you say, “Wow, this is really hot. ” The main thing is that it involves a U. S. citizen, and as soon as something involves a U. S. citizen, a whole different set of procedures [goes] into play. Whether it involves the   or something came across with your [Kathy Gilsinan’s] name on it, it simply cannot be used —  it cannot be put into a normal intelligence report, because the United States does not collect or report on Americans. So there are two aspects of it. Number one, it was about a U. S. citizen number two, it was about our   [then the Republican presidential nominee]. For example, sometimes the NSA will obtain signals intelligence which says something about an American, or the NSA or CIA has a spy report that talks about an American citizen. What’s done in those cases is that the identity of the citizen is blocked out in the original report, and then [determining] who that American really is requires a set of extraordinary permissions at a very high level within the community. But you can imagine, if you sent this up saying    went to    a hotel, it’d be pretty [thinly] that you’d actually be able disguise who it was about. Therefore you would simply keep the whole thing in a very restricted channel, and send it up to your boss and say, “What the hell do we do with this?” Gilsinan: But can the FBI collect information on American citizens? Blair: Only if it has a warrant. The only way the FBI could go out and collect the information on what Americans are doing overseas, for example, would be if they went to a judge [and] got a warrant based on reasonable suspicion that a crime was being committed. In that case, they could then conduct surveillance, put a listening bug into a room. But that’s all done with the FBI —  the   agency —  and they’re either investigating a crime, or if they have a suspicion, they have to go through the warrant process that we’re all familiar with. And that’s true for overseas investigation as well as for domestic ones. Gilsinan: And the FBI tried to get a warrant in this case? Blair: Oh, did they? Gilsinan: They tried to get a FISA warrant, and the judge rejected their request. Blair: Good, good, the FISA system works. Gilsinan: So then it sounds like there’s not much they could do to investigate this, right? The reports that I’m reading say, “the FBI had been trying to check this out and hadn’t been able to verify anything. ” What you’re saying seems to suggest that they wouldn’t legally be able to check it out anyway? Blair: Correct. My understanding is that there’s no evidence that a crime was committed, there’s no suspicion, so they don’t have any grounds to take it any further. A field office wouldn’t sit on something like this and make up its own ideas. This would be handled at headquarters. Based on what you said and what I know about it, I don’t see any compelling rationale to investigate it. That’s stuff that reporters investigate, not the FBI. Gilsinan: So there are the salacious allegations, but there are also allegations in the document of people in the Trump campaign accepting money or colluding with Russia, which would be a crime, right? In which case the FBI could’ve investigated that, but they would’ve still needed a warrant. Blair: I haven’t read this document. If a document comes across and says a crime has been committed, then the FBI has initial grounds to investigate and there are things they can do without a warrant. Just to choose [an] example, if a document that they receive in an unexpected fashion says that a bank robbery occurred a couple of weeks ago, then it’s worth checking with the bank, and you can do that without a warrant. But then the minute you go further into having to take any action that invades the privacy of a suspect, then you have to have a warrant. Gilsinan: So hypothetically, the FBI could’ve asked the Ritz Carlton Moscow, “Who showed up?” —   right? Blair: Yeah, was there a reservation in this person’s name on this date? That’s sort of an easy one to check without violating privacy, and puts you in the ballpark of reality on something like this. Gilsinan: But then they would have to stop there? Like, suppose the answer was yes. Then what happens? Blair: Well, suppose the answer was, “We’re not going to tell you our guest records are private. ” Then they would have had to have gotten a warrant, convince the judge it was probable enough that they could proceed. Gilsinan: What’s your reaction as an intelligence professional about how this got out? You were saying that, within the intelligence community, this kind of thing would be very closely held, and yet it was bouncing around DC for a couple of months. What’s your feeling on that? How could that happen? Blair: The report itself was provided to several news organizations, right, in addition to the FBI. On the [question of] how did the information get out that [a briefing summarizing the dossier’s conclusions] was provided to the   [by intelligence officials] I guess you look at it two ways. The way I’ve always found most fruitful is the cui bono test: Who would either get an advantage or get a kick out of leaking it? The people who knew about [the briefing] within the intelligence community were pretty highly placed. They’ve been involved in public spats with the president[ ]. They know it’s not good for them or for the   or for their future relationships, so why in the world would they put this out and make their lives even more difficult? So what does that lead you to? That leads you to   people who know about it but are not involved substantively and just get a kick out of seeing shitstorms in the paper and being able to say to their buddies over a beer, “You know that big story? I did that. ” That does happen. You do have cipher clerks who handle it, and secretaries who set up meetings and so on, and I’ve found over time that there are some who just get a kick out of reading awful stuff in the press, as long as it was they who provided it. And that could’ve been on the intelligence side or on the [side of]   Trump’s [transition team]. The way you do leak investigations is you go through the real police detective work of “Okay, let’s get a copy of every document, let’s trace every time it was sent, who was on the distribution list, every meeting in which it was discussed —  what was the attendance list? Let’s go out and talk to all of them. ” Gilsinan: But [the document itself] could also have come from the private company itself or from the campaigns it was working for —  not necessarily a leak from the intel community. What to make of the fact that the allegations were taken seriously enough that officials felt they had to brief the president and the  ? Blair: There is no more powerful force in Washington than, “What if this comes out somehow and I was found not to have done my utmost?” Just think of the position that the intelligence leadership has been in for the last couple of weeks. I’m sure they sat around and thought, “What if we sat on this [and] it comes out somehow that we were sitting on it, [and] the   said, ‘You knew about this and you didn’t tell me that it was out there? ’” Those were the Scylla and a Charybdis that they were caught between, and I can very much understand a decision to provide it to the  . They clearly, based on what they’ve said, made all of the qualifications of, “We haven’t investigated this this is not verified but boss, you need to know this is out there. ” I think they made that call, rather than saying, “Let’s bury this. ” Because then I think the chances within the intelligence community of a leak would be much greater, especially in the FBI which has this sort of sense of entitlement among a lot of its agents that they know more than their director does. They’re happy to tell you news people how they do it happens all the time. Gilsinan: Anything else? Blair: I would just give you one of Blair’s Laws developed over the years: If there is a choice in explaining a government action between a Machiavellian, clever, ingenious plot to achieve that result and sort of blind, bumbling,   incompetence, choose number two all the time."
53334,73517,Waking Up to Coachella’s Conservative Tinge,Atlantic,Spencer Kornhaber,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Just as one   businessman takes command politically, another has become the focus of debate in rock and roll. Earlier in January, the music press suddenly seemed to realize that the parent company of Coachella, the iconic   Southern California festival, is owned by Philip Anschutz, a prominent Republican donor who has supported efforts hostile to LGBT rights. The fallout: calls for boycotts, accusations of “fake news,” and a petition asking headliners Beyonce, Radiohead, and Kendrick Lamar to donate their festival profits to the Human Rights Campaign. The situation that led to the brouhaha isn’t new. In fact, it’s one that is very familiar in American entertainment. A large corporation long ago acquired a cultural organization valued for its coolness, and   consumers and creators continued to patronize it in spite of the fact that large corporation owners don’t tend to lean left. Only by a quirk of the moment —  some combination of the online media economy, shifting generational mores, the election, and this year’s particular headliners —  have the politics behind Coachella become a factor. How Fashion   Coachella, The festival’s operator Goldenvoice first made a name as an independent champion of underground sounds in Southern California in the ’80s and ’90s, but in 2001 Anschutz Entertainment Group bought it. “The deal   …     should give Anschutz’s concert division, Concerts West, added credibility in rock music circles,” the Los Angeles Times wrote back then. Coachella’s present national profile largely came about after the acquisition —  as did its   format, sister   and   festivals, and $375   price tag (up from $50 in 1999). Anschutz’s name really should be familiar: His holdings include the country’s   movies chain, Regal Entertainment, and AEG Live runs a number of prominent events venues, among other things. The man’s politics have never been a secret. In 2003, OC Weekly wrote about the Anschutz Foundation —  the philanthropy founded by Anschutz that is the source of the current controversy —  noting that it had given money to a group whose goal was to stop “the militant gay agenda” and who claimed that “pedophilia is a basic part of the homosexual lifestyle. ” Over the years, news accounts have mentioned Anschutz or his foundation supporting the likes of Focus on the Family and Rick Santorum while he bankrolled   movies and The Weekly Standard. What ostensibly got it all started this time around was a (now deleted) blog post at Afropunk that praised the newly announced Coachella 2017 lineup but said that Anschutz’s “politics are icky, sticky with the slime of the swamp that folks like   Trump loves to associate [with]. ” Uproxx aggregated the info about Anschutz’s donations to   groups and his ties to   deniers, which then went viral to such an extent that AEG and Anschutz himself replied. The company said that “attempts to perpetuate and spread false news on a variety of topics are part of a   and coordinated attempt by our competitors to smear AEG” and touted “a supportive and inclusive environment that respects the rights of all employees, artists and fans, as well as promoting a philosophy of sustainability throughout the world. ” Anschuntz’s denial was more colorful, bearing some rhetorical trademarks of the current political moment: Recent claims published in the media that I am   are nothing more than fake news —  it is all garbage. I unequivocally support the rights of all people without regard to sexual orientation. We are fortunate to employ a wealth of diverse individuals throughout our family of companies, all of whom are important to us —  the only criteria on which they are judged is the quality of their job performance we do not tolerate discrimination in any form. Both The Anschutz Foundation and I contribute to numerous organizations that pursue a wide range of causes.  Neither I nor the Foundation fund any organization with the purpose or expectation that it would finance   initiatives, and when it has come to my attention or the attention of The Anschutz Foundation that certain organizations either the Foundation or I have funded have been supporting such causes, we have immediately ceased all contributions to such groups. It’s an odd reply because it can so easily be picked apart. Pitchfork quickly pulled financial disclosure documents showing that in the past five years the Anschutz Foundation has parceled out hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Family Research Council, and the National Christian Foundation. The first two organizations have clear histories of opposing gay rights the National Christian Foundation provides significant funding for the Alliance Defending Freedom. The outrage is a sign that Coachella, like a lot of   events, is assumed to be associated with liberal ideology: Roger Waters famously blasted George W. Bush from the stage in 2008 and then blasted Donald Trump last year at a Coachella   festival 2017’s three headliners are all politically outspoken and to the left flower crowns and MDMA don’t generally don’t scream Republicanism. Yet all along the festival has also drawn accusations of   troubling headware, and rank consumerism: The Daily Beast’s Marlow Stern described it as an “Oasis For Douchebags and Trust Fund Babies. ” It might seem tempting to now single Coachella out as a uniquely corporate appropriation of indie aesthetics. But many   in Southern California —  L. A.’s FYF Fest and Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival —  are also AEG Live productions. So are other significant fests like Seattle’s Bumbershoot. Major League Soccer is flush with Anschutz money, as are thousands of movie theaters. The issue at hand is, in reality, far more entrenched in the   arena than just Coachella. It may not be a coincidence that new attention is being paid to this fact in the same month of Trump’s inauguration —  after all, the Afropunk post that began the dustup compared Anschutz to Trump. In any case, the backlash —  however belated it might seem —  hasn’t quite been futile. When Pitchfork contacted the Anschutz Foundation about its donations, its lawyer reportedly said that   groups would get no money from the organization going forward. “Once it was explained to us that there was an issue, it stopped,” he said. It’s not a revolution, but it is the kind of thing a lot of people are clearly itching for lately: a change in the previously ignored status quo."
53335,73518,Ranked: The World’s Most Unusual Places to Hold Political Meetings,Atlantic,Matt Peterson,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Next week, the meeting to end all meetings takes place in Davos, Switzerland, as the high and mighty gather to discuss the fate of the world order. Did you hear Xi Jinping is going? Still, for those who can’t make it through the velvet ropes, being seen can require a little creativity about where to meet. Here are a few of the world’s more unusual meeting places that have popped up this week. Ranked: Twitter Wars That Came a Little Too Close to Real Wars, 3. A Russian aircraft carrier. If Americans want to feel superior to Russians, they need look no further than the fleet of Russian aircraft carriers. It is a fleet of one, the Admiral Kuznetsov, which travels with a tug in case of breakdowns. Nonetheless, the Kuznetsov was the place to be this week, particularly if you’re a renegade general. The Russians anchored the ship near Tobruk, Libya, and took on board Khalifa Haftar, a Libyan who has been leading a rebellion against the weak but internationally backed official government of Libya. The visit was nominally so he could meet by video link with Russia’s defense minister —  no word on whether his headwear made a stir on this trip, as it did on a visit to Moscow recently —  but more likely so he could be shown off to the world as a thumb in the eye of the West. Still, there’s reason to hope it was a short meeting, if only because many of the bathrooms on the Kuznetsov don’t work. 2. Houston. For a little while this week, Texas got to relive its glory days as an independent republic. Under the suddenly newsworthy One China Policy, the president of Taiwan is not generally allowed to visit the U. S. with one glaring exception. The Taiwanese leader is allowed to stop in the U. S. “in transit” to other destinations, a loophole that allows for quite a bit more than just aircraft refueling. Tsai   took advantage of that on Sunday, when she stopped in Houston en route to Central America. To make it even more glamorous, she met with U. S. Senator Ted Cruz, who was busy not being president of the United States. No word yet if she met with   President Carly Fiorina. 1. Trump Tower Ice Cream Parlor. Let’s say you’re running for office. And let’s say you want to be seen as part of an international movement of   but for whatever reason, you don’t actually want a photo op with Mr. Brexit himself, the  . What do you do? Why, schedule a meeting in the Trump Tower ice cream parlor, of course. And that’s apparently what Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French National Front, and current   for the first round of France’s presidential election, did this week. Reporters stumbled across her meeting with a   activist in Trump Tower on Thursday. Both Le Pen and Trump’s camp deny any meeting took place between the two. But Trump Tower is a pretty hard place to wander into by accident, given the   police barricades outside. Who knows, maybe next time she and Trump can meet in France. After all, if there’s one place that might be covered in enough gold for Trump, it would be Versailles.

53336,73519,A Fight Over Ethics in the Age of Trump,Atlantic,Clare Foran,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"The 2016 presidential election and its aftermath have highlighted the extent to which a deeply divided American public interprets events and information through a partisan lens. After all, Oxford Dictionaries even picked “ ” as its Word of the Year. Under Donald Trump’s administration, even basic ethical standards in government appear poised to become a subject of political controversy. Obamacare Repeal Moves a Step Closer to Reality, On Wednesday, the director of the U. S. Office of Government Ethics, an independent agency, publicly denounced Trump’s plans to turn control of his business empire over to his sons —  a plan that a lawyer working for Trump characterized as the best approach “from a conflicts and ethics perspective. ” By contrast, Walter Shaub, the federal ethics chief, declared the  ’s strategy effectively “meaningless” as a proposal to prevent conflicts of interest. It wasn’t the first time the OGE director had weighed in on the transition process for the incoming presidential administration. He had previously expressed concern over the pace of confirmation hearings for Cabinet nominees who had not yet finished an ethics review process. In November, the office’s Twitter account sent out a series of seemingly inscrutable tweets about Trump’s “total divestiture” from his business assets, which the   hadn’t announced he had done. Now, Republicans seem to be targeting the ethics watchdog. The New York Times obtained and published a letter sent by Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, to Shaub. Dated Thursday, it warns that the “agency’s mission is to provide clear ethics guidance, not engage in public relations. ” Chaffetz requested that Shaub appear “for a transcribed interview with committee staff as soon as possible,” so that the committee can better “understand how you perceive OGE’s role, among other things. ” Politico reported on Thursday that Chaffetz “threatened to subpoena” Shaub “if he refuses to participate in an official interview. ” (A spokesperson for the committee did not reply to a request for comment and confirmation of the letter’s authenticity. OGE spokespeople also did not return calls asking for comment.) Democrats quickly condemned the action. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Friday called the episode “outrageous” and accused Chaffetz of “seeking to intimidate a senior   official. ” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had harsh words as well: “Mr. Chaffetz’s attempt to bully Mr. Shaub out of doing his job are absolutely despicable. ” But Chaffetz’s apparent instinct to criticize OGE isn’t his alone. America Rising, an   group that works against Democrats, has raised questions about Shaub’s competence. “In the last few weeks, Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, has not been quiet in his criticism of the incoming administration,” a post on the group’s website reads. “Unsurprisingly, Shaub’s comments have been used by congressional Democrats to try and score points. ” Concerns over Trump’s potential conflicts of interest are not wholly a partisan squabble, though they may be starting to appear that way. The key ethical concerns raised by the OGE director have been echoed by many ethics experts, including George W. Bush’s former chief ethics lawyer Richard Painter. Following Trump’s announcement that he will turn over his company to his sons, Painter released a joint statement along with Norman Eisen, the former ethics czar under President Obama, saying that Trump’s announced    plan “falls short in every respect. ” Yet the more that Trump’s allies can paint ethical concern over the incoming administration’s actions as partisan, the easier it will be for Trump and his supporters to discredit criticism the   faces as solely motivated by political calculation. That puts ethics experts in a seemingly impossible bind as they try to make sure their concerns are heard: the more they speak out, the more Trump loyalists will rush to criticize them as partisan actors. That, in turn, could have a   detrimental impact on the perceived credibility of ethics experts. This challenge does not seem to be lost on the ethics experts attempting to sound the alarm over Trump’s potential conflicts of interest as president. “I hope that   Trump, soon to become President Trump, refuses to support public attacks on the Office of Government Ethics or its director,” Painter said on Wednesday at a Brookings Institution forum. “We are not going to, in this country, tolerate the dismantling of independent ethics agencies. ” He added: “Those that are attacking the Office of Congressional Ethics or the Office of Government Ethics should be ashamed of themselves, and have no place in our democracy. ” Painter was in part referencing an attempt by House Republicans to gut the independent and nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics behind closed doors earlier this month, a plan lawmakers backed away from amid public backlash. Trump was part of that public backlash. “With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority,” the   tweeted in January. Crucially, though, Trump didn’t actually protest efforts to gut the office on the merits —  he only protested lawmakers’ timing. When it comes to the OCE, Trump didn’t have much at stake given that the office acts as a congressional watchdog. By contrast, the Office of Government Ethics conducts oversight of the executive branch. There’s little reason to think Trump would criticize his fellow Republicans for targeting the watchdog that’s watching him."
53337,73520,Obamacare Repeal Moves a Step Closer to Reality,Atlantic,Russell Berman,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Republicans in Congress can now repeal most of the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority vote. The House on Friday passed a budget resolution allowing Congress to bypass a Democratic filibuster in the Senate if and when they vote to gut the health law. The vote was   with nine Republicans joining all the Democrats in opposition. The Senate passed the same measure earlier this week on vote of  . Because the resolution is a   budget blueprint and not an act of law, it does not require a presidential signature. What Congress approved this week was a necessary procedural step giving Republicans the power to repeal the tax and spending provisions of Obamacare, and the party demonstrated the ability to overcome some internal resistance to moving so quickly to dismantle the system enacted by President Obama and congressional Democrats. But the next step will be much harder —  actually repealing the Affordable Care Act. House and Senate committees must draft and pass legislation in accordance with the budget resolution, and party leaders will need to unify    Republicans around a move that could generate significant political blowback from constituents anxious about how repeal will affect their health coverage. Under pressure from   Donald Trump, GOP leaders have begun pledging to begin replacing Obamacare concurrently with repeal, but its not yet clear how they intend to do that given that the party has been unable to coalesce around specific healthcare legislation in the six years since the law was enacted. The debate in the House on Friday provided a preview of the much more consequential fight to come. Republicans argued that the health law was already failing on its own and that they were moving urgently to “rescue” Americans struggling under rising premiums and fewer insurance options. “My colleagues, this experiment has failed. This law is collapsing as we speak,” Speaker Paul Ryan declared in a floor speech. “And we have to step in before things get even worse. “This is nothing short of a rescue mission,” he said. “By taking this step today, we are doing what is right. We are doing what is urgent. And we are keeping our promise to the American people. ” “This law is collapsing as we speak. And we have to step in before things get even worse. This is nothing short of a rescue mission. To Democrats, this was all hogwash. They assailed Republicans for seeking to strip healthcare from more than 20 million people who have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act with no plan ready to replace it. They said Republicans were misleading the public by criticizing the law’s higher costs, pointing out that the rate of growth in prices had actually slowed during the past several years. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader and the architect of the ACA, denounced the GOP’s “mythology” about the law and said they had nothing but a “     plan” to put in its place. “The Republicans are feeding their ideological obsession with repealing the ACA,” she said, her hands slicing the air for emphasis. After each Republican spoke, Democratic Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the party’s senior member on the Budget Committee, responded by reading statistics of the number of people who stood to lose coverage in their state because of repeal. Republicans arranged piles of documents around their rostrum to demonstrate the many proposals they had put forward to replace Obamacare. Most of them involved a renewed emphasis on health savings accounts and creating     pools to cover people with   conditions while lowering costs for healthier consumers. “We have a plan,” said Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois. “We’re going to cover preexisting conditions because my wife’s a cancer survivor and we have to do that!” Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, scoffed. “Wheres the plan?” he asked of Republicans. “You have a lot of paper over there, but it’s not a plan. ” A few Republicans rose to criticize the budget resolution, noting that while it paves the way for repeal of Obamacare it also assumes trillions of dollars in additional debt. “Reluctantly I will vote for this,” said Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia, a   member. “I’ll vote to pass this here today, but I refuse to call it a budget. ” In the end, most Republicans who shared Garrett’s concerns supported the resolution anyway, moving repeal of the Affordable Care Act one step closer to reality."
53338,73521,How Victoria Aims to Connect With Young Women ,Atlantic,Nancy West,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Victoria, a new miniseries charting the famous queen’s early reign, premieres Sunday on PBS’s Masterpiece —  nearly 180 years after the monarch ascended the British throne and five days before Donald Trump assumes the American presidency. Here in Columbia, Missouri, the college town where I live and teach, we had a special preview of Victoria’s opening episode on December 5th. Over 500 people turned up, most of them women in their 40s through 60s. But college students, many of whom came into adulthood following the soapy adventures of Downton Abbey’s Lady Mary and Lady Edith, also attended. So did teenagers, who texted right up to the moment the lights went out. Judging by audience reactions and conversations I had with attendees, the older women enjoyed Victoria, but the younger ones devoured it. They oohed and aahed over the palaces. The gardens. The   gowns. Many gushed over Victoria’s lapdog. Some mooned over Rufus Sewell, who plays a smoldering Lord Melbourne. Most of all, they seemed to thrill at watching a feisty teenage girl running a country. Afterward, in the theater’s lobby, their comments entwined Victoria with the U. S. election. “Why can’t we live in England, where people are smart enough to put a female in charge?” one asked another. “I want a girl NOW for president!” declared a child of nine or ten, whose teenage sister replied, “America doesn’t want a woman in power. ” Her words spoke to the value of shows like Victoria: In offering true stories about inspiring leaders, period dramas can speak to the politics of the present. And, in the case of Victoria, to  young women. The Crown Is a Sweeping, Sumptuous History Lesson, The miniseries exemplifies a new turn in British television period drama, away from literary adaptations and toward political history. Within the last two years, over 20 such dramas have appeared, and, according to sources like IMDB, at least 20 more are in production. They include Wolf Hall Rebellion The Hollow Crown Churchill’s Secret Victoria The Crown and King Charles III. If we assume that period drama is always somehow about national identity, these series offer British audiences a way to think critically about nationhood in the wake of Brexit, the referendum whereby 52 percent of British citizens voted to leave the European Union. But in the months after the U. S. election, as Victoria illustrates, they also give Americans a means to reflect on leadership —  its abuses and constraints, its symbols and privileges, its long history as an anxious and inconstant idea. Like Victoria, these series seek to engage young audiences. Many of the shows portray political leaders in their youth, casting popular actors like Matt Smith (who plays Prince Philip in The Crown) and Jenna Coleman (who plays Victoria). Collectively, they also seem to renounce nostalgia, that emotion so native to the genre and so appealing to, ahem, older audiences. With its understated tone and    approach to the Windsor family, The Crown, for example, seems to studiously avoid sentimentality about the past. Wolf Hall’s portrait of Henry the VIII’s court, despite its stunningly beautiful camerawork, recalls scenes from The Godfather more than it does earlier period dramas about the king. It’s as if the past is no longer to be wistfully mourned but, rather, reconsidered. Hence, the surprises that lie in wait for many viewers, whether the discovery that Prince Philip was a radical reformer, or that Wolf Hall’s Thomas Cromwell wasn’t quite the nasty thug we thought him. Victoria, however, delivers the biggest surprise. Although scores of photographs exist of Victoria as a young woman in the 1830s and 40s, an image of her as a stout, jowly sourpuss garbed in widow’s weeds persists —  as do certain myths about her monarchy. Myth #1: Victoria relinquished all political responsibility to her husband, Prince Albert, after they got married. Myth #2: Victoria stopped ruling once her beloved Albert died. Myth #3: Victoria remained a grieving widow, an incurable melancholic, up to the day she drew her last breath. These myths are, of course, “dead wrong,” Daisy Goodwin, the creator and writer of Victoria, told me. As a doctoral student at Cambridge University, Goodwin wrote her dissertation on Victoria, using the queen’s voluminous diaries to unearth a woman who reveled in the freedom the crown brought her, who loved sex and relished power. The reward of finding this Other Victoria has deeply influenced Goodwin, a novelist and TV producer who said she “loves filling in the female blanks of British history. ” Projected to run for six seasons, Victoria spans the long life and career of the queen. For Goodwin, who wanted to try a “bigger, less solitary project” than   it marks a foray into scriptwriting. But how do you begin the story of a woman who ruled for 64 years? Goodwin got her answer after having a fight with her teenage daughter, Lydia, about homework. Reflecting on how Victoria assumed   power at roughly the same age, she wondered, “What would it be like if Lydia were the boss of me?”  And so Victoria took root. The first season, airing weekly through March 5, follows Victoria from the time she becomes Queen in 1837 through her courtship and marriage to Albert.  It portrays Victoria as a bold, sparkling, and clever teenager possessed of an iron will. “The first thing she did was give herself a new name,” Goodwin tells me. The monarch’s real name was Alexandrina Victoria, but as Goodwin explains, “Nobody back then was called Victoria. It was . ..  like calling yourself Beyonce. ” Still, Victoria’s first season doesn’t seek to lionize its subject or sugarcoat her reign. “She makes tremendous mistakes,” Goodwin says, “because she doesn’t yet understand the world in which she is operating. She shows girls that you can make mistakes and move on. ” For example, Victoria callously decides to have the unwed Flora Hastings, one of her    medically examined when she suspects Hastings is pregnant. It turns out the devoutly religious woman had a tumor. She dies soon afterward. Humbled and ashamed, Victoria becomes a much less impulsive ruler after this event. As the series evolves, Victoria will also need to take into account those aspects of Victoria’s reign that cannot be written off as youthful “mistakes. ” The British government’s response to the Irish potato famine during the 1840s and early 1850s, for example, was horrendously inadequate. Victoria often expressed pity for the plight of the Irish, but she took no action to address it. And so one million people starved to death over the course of seven years, thrown into the ground without ceremonies or coffins. During the Indian Mutiny of 1859, Victoria offered her support to those military leaders who punished troops for their revengeful actions against the Indian rebels. But during her reign, countless women in India, Africa, and elsewhere were raped or killed or widowed in the endless series of “little wars” that expanded her empire. Future Victoria episodes remain to be seen, but one hopes Goodwin will also address these more complex, more systemic failures her audience needs to know about them too. For now, and in keeping with its youthful appeal, Victoria’s first season deploys conventions from romance, fairytale, and   fiction but refashions them to offer a complex portrait of its female protagonist. The series makes Victoria the dominant character (she appears in every scene of all seven episodes). It romanticizes her relationship with Lord Melbourne, the older and wiser man, but underscores his shortcomings as well as hers. The show plays up Albert as Victoria’s Prince Charming but also portrays him as a   nerd who’s far less appealing to watch. And as with all   fiction, the series presents a protagonist who matures quickly and dramatically by the end of the season, Victoria is far kinder and less impulsive than she was at the outset. Most notably, Victoria offers elemental truths about courage, love, justice, and kindness all through a female perspective. No doubt, some critics will view Victoria’s portrait of the queen as naïve or simplistic. They’ll point out the inaccuracies or scoff at the show’s occasional use of caricature. But they’d be missing the point: Victoria aims to provide a political history that resonates with today’s young women. And, apparently, in Britain it  has. Victoria consistently dominated TV ratings with a consolidated average of seven million viewers, according to Goodwin. She added that many of the show’s viewers were females between 13 and 25, and that Victoria is the   period drama ever among this age group in the U. K.  Some of these viewers tweet Goodwin about their new resolve to study history or post photos of themselves hugging their copy of Goodwin’s novel, Victoria. Hundreds of these women, calling themselves “Vicbournes,” have taken to writing fan fiction or creating mashups based on the series, imagining plots in which Victoria elopes with Lord Melbourne. “It’s a real phenomenon here,” Goodwin says. Like her, these girls are filling in the female blanks. But they also live in a country with a strong tradition of women holding top political positions, including the prime minister. And what of America’s young women —  will they enjoy Victoria? The night of my hometown’s preview suggests the answer is yes, but with a caveat, a subtext. As that night conveyed, many young women in America remain devastated by the election. Recently, when I asked one of my college students to share her thoughts with me about Hillary Clinton’s defeat, she said, “The election told me that it doesn’t matter how smart you are, how qualified you are, how well you understand the system and can play the game —  you will never win. ” Comments like these raise questions about period drama’s relevance and responsibility to young women, especially now. As a story grounded in history, Victoria can give them hope coupled with truth. Young viewers can think, “This story happened and so, no matter what present history tells me, a woman can be in power. ”   Rebecca Eaton, the executive producer of Masterpiece, tells me Victoria’s U. S. premiere wasn’t timed to coincide with the week of the presidential inauguration. But she says she hopes it will have a positive influence on America’s young women. Since Masterpiece’s rebranding in 2008, Eaton has aggressively sought period dramas that will capture a new audience of “smart girls,” girls in their teens and 20s who read good books, imagine big careers, and want to learn about history. Until this past year, Eaton had mainly been focused on providing them with good drama. But 2017 brings a slightly different agenda. “This is a very important time to present stories of strong, independent women,” says Eaton. “Victoria had her own glass ceiling. She was surrounded by men who told her she couldn’t do the job. ” She adds, “I’m very pleased to have this story at a time when women’s issues, unfortunately, are back in play all over again. ” On Sunday night, I’ll   Victoria with my    niece Sophie and her friends. I’ll take pleasure in seeing their reactions and sharing with them what I know about Victoria’s life: how she often performed small, individual acts of kindness to the poor how, against the advice of her senior counselors, she pardoned   criminals how she survived eight assassination attempts. It will be a different viewing party than those I had for Downton Abbey, a more earnest experience. We’ll watch Victoria not because it depicts an   past, but because it portrays their imagined future."
53339,73522,Betsy DeVos’s Accountability Problem,Atlantic,Allie Gross,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Donald Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has proven to be polarizing. Teachers, unions, and   advocates have argued that DeVos wants to see public education dismantled. They point to the fact that the Michigan billionaire, and the   groups she funds, have pushed to funnel public dollars away from traditional public schools and into charter and private schools. DeVos’s proponents, however, argue that adult interests have taken over the education arena and that the nominee supports school choice because the traditional   system has failed kids. “Detroit Public Schools are academically and financially bankrupt, and they’ve lost the privilege of educating children in Detroit,” Gary Naeyaert, the Executive Director of the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) a   group DeVos bankrolls and helped govern until November, wrote in a 2015 press release describing a plan to “relieve DPS of all teaching responsibilities. ” While previous education secretaries, including the Obama appointees Arne Duncan and John King, have endorsed models such as charter schools, DeVos has been scrutinized for her connection to unfettered charter growth in Detroit, where —  over two decades after Michigan’s charter experiment began —  the competition enabled by school choice generally hasn’t lived up to the promise of better options. More than half of Detroit’s   students attend a charter school, but last year fewer than 1 percent of the city’s schools were given an A or B+ grade, according to Excellent Schools Detroit, a clearinghouse for school shoppers in the Motor City. Eighty percent of the state’s charter operators are   which not only reduces financial accountability, but has also earned Michigan a nickname as the “Wild Wild West” for education. In 1999, researchers from Michigan State University assessed   laws across the nation and concluded that Michigan —  along with Arizona and Delaware —  had the most permissive   laws in the nation, noting that in the Mitten anyone can start a school, and that there are very few boundaries when it comes to who could authorize a charter school. That second factor has proven to be one of the touchiest. Today there are 45 different   authorizers in Michigan —  one of the highest numbers nationally —  and there is still no comprehensive, or precise, statute detailing what their oversight should look like. In 2014, the National Association of Charter School Authorizers gave Michigan only three out of 27 points when it measured the state’s authorizing policies against the organization’s own best practices. That same year the Detroit Free Press published a   investigation into the state’s charter sector, highlighting mismanagement, sinking accountability, and flaws in oversight. DeVos’s role in fostering this unregulated environment has become particularly important as of late. Detractors point to the fact that, in 2011, GLEP successfully killed a provision that would stop failing schools from duplicating this past year, the organization helped stop the creation of the Detroit Education Commissions (DEC) a panel that would have overseen school openings and closings in Detroit, arguing that the commission would hurt charters by prioritizing the stability of district public schools. DeVos advocates, however, remain steadfast that she is being unfairly labeled as  . They cite DeVos’s support last year of legislation that would create of   letter grades to hold schools accountable and enable automatic closures of persistently failing ones in Detroit. “Organizations supported by DeVos backed an   report card for schools, a ban on authorizer shopping and automatic closure for   charter schools. That sure doesn’t sound like opposing ‘any regulation,’ does it?” Dan Quisenberry, the president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies wrote in a December letter to The New York Times following the publication of an article that documented DeVos’s push to eliminate the DEC. To get a better understanding of what DeVos proponents are talking about when they say she supports accountability, I decided to zero in on the part of the 2016 law cited by Quisenberry that details how Michigan handles failing schools. Looking at the legislation, which was introduced by freshman Republican State Representative Daniela Garcia, who received $18, 000 from DeVos family members, I found an ambiguous   with numerous loopholes. While the federal Every Student Succeeds Act allows states to design their own accountability policies, dissecting how the   Michigan law does, and doesn’t, hold schools accountable may help illuminate how she could approach the issue from the bully pulpit. Provisions from the law appear below in grey, with explanations of the resulting loopholes immediately following each passage. DeVos declined to comment for this story, with a spokeswoman for the Trump transition team writing, “The Secretary designate is not granting interviews at this time. ”   * * * Sec. 507 (5) Except for a public school academy that is an alternative school serving a special student population, if the state school   officer determines that a public school academy site that has been operating for at least 4 years is among the lowest achieving 5% of all public schools in this state for the immediately preceding 3 school years, as determined under section 1280c, not to include any individualized education plan subgroup, the state school   redesign officer shall notify the public school academy’s authorizing body. Also, except for a public school academy that is an alternative school serving a special student population, after the accountability system under section 390 has been in effect in the community district for at least 3 full school years, if the state school   officer determines that a public school academy site located in a community district has been assigned a grade of “F” under section 390 for the immediately preceding 3 school years, and is not currently undergoing reconstitution under this section, the state school   officer shall notify the public school academy’s authorizing body. Subject to subsection (6) if an authorizing body receives notice from the state school   officer under this subsection, the authorizing body shall amend the public school academy’s contract to eliminate the public school academy’s authority to operate the existing age and grade levels at the site and the public school academy shall cease operating the existing age and grade levels at the site, effective at the end of the current school year. Subject to subsection (6) if the public school academy operates at only 1 site, and the authorizing body receives notice from the state school   officer under this subsection, the authorizing body shall revoke the public school academy’s contract, effective at the end of the current school year. If a charter school in Detroit gets an F grade three years in a row, the state must notify the school’s authorizer. (Authorizers in Michigan are entities tasked with overseeing charters, such as a school district, public university, or community college. They get up to 3 percent of the state aid each charter school receives, in exchange for their sponsorship.)  The law does not not say the authorizer must close the charter once it learns of the status. Rather, it instructs the authorizer to amend its contract with the school to eliminate the current age and grade levels it is currently teaching. Hypothetically, this could mean if a failing charter teaches grades kindergarten through five, rather than close the school the authorizer can just amend the contract to let the school teach grades six through nine. Sec. 507 (6) For a public school academy or site that is subject to a notice to its authorizing body under this subsection, the state school   officer shall consider other public school options available to pupils in the grade levels offered by the public school academy or site who reside in the geographic area served by the public school academy or site. If the state school   officer determines that closure of the public school academy or site would result in an unreasonable hardship to these pupils because there are insufficient other public school options reasonably available for these pupils, the state school   officer may rescind the notice. If the state school   redesign officer rescinds a notice subjecting a public school academy or site to closure, the state school   officer shall do so before the end of the school year. If the state school   officer rescinds a notice subjecting a public school academy or site to closure, the state school   officer shall require the public school academy or site to implement a school improvement plan that includes measures to increase pupil growth and improve pupil proficiency, with growth and proficiency measured by performance on state assessments. If the state’s School   Office, which was placed under the Republican governor’s purview in 2015, decides that closing a charter would “result in unreasonable hardship” for students or that there are “insufficient other public school options” available, the office can rescind a closure notice and instead put the failing charter on a   plan. Sec. 507 (7) Except as otherwise provided in section 502 or 503, the decision of an authorizing body to issue, not issue, or reconstitute a contract under this part, or to terminate or revoke a contract under this section, is solely within the discretion of the authorizing body, is final, and is not subject to review by a court or any state agency. An authorizing body that issues, does not issue, or reconstitutes a contract under this part, or that terminates or revokes a contract under this section, is not liable for that action to the public school academy, the public school academy corporation, a pupil of the public school academy, the parent or guardian of a pupil of the public school academy, or any other person. Unless the charter school is authorized by a traditional   district (which applies to fewer than 15 percent of the charters in Detroit) the authorizers’ decision to close a school is “solely within the discretion of the authorizing body. ” This means the accountability —  i. e. the decision to close a failing school —  is up to the authorizer. Authorizers have a monetary incentive to keep schools open, as they get a percentage of a school’s state aid. This subsection also notes that the decision of the authorizer is “final,” “not subject to review by court or any other state agency,” and that the authorizer cannot be held “liable” for their decision. In layman’s terms, they are protected within law in the event that they make bad decisions. Sec. 507 (8) Except as otherwise provided in this section, before an authorizing body revokes a contract, the authorizing body may consider and take corrective measures to avoid revocation. An authorizing body may reconstitute the public school academy in a final attempt to improve student educational performance or to avoid interruption of the educational process. An authorizing body shall include a reconstituting provision in the contract that identifies these corrective measures, including, but not limited to, canceling a contract with an educational management organization, if any, withdrawing approval of a contract under section 506, or appointing a new board of directors or a trustee to take over operation of the public school academy, Here the law says that instead of closing a failing charter, an authorizer may “take corrective action to avoid revocation. ” The legislation gives some suggestions of how this could occur —  such as appointing new board members or swapping out a management company —  instead of closing the school. This option comes with its own share of chaos and games. As a reporter in Detroit, I have written about how management company owners have been known to shuffle from one company to another in order to avoid responsibility but maintain control of a school. Notably, the legislation also says that these moves —  changing management companies, getting a new board —  are just suggestions the authorizer can ultimately come up with its own “corrective actions,” which leaves a lot of wiggle room. * * * In addition to creating windows to get around closures, the law doesn’t apply accountability evenly —  something that Naeyaert had said was important to his group and why it did not get behind the DEC. Rather, the law largely leaves a charter school’s fate in the hands of its authorizer, while traditional   closures are left to the state’s School   Office. That office also has the option of rescinding a closure if it would create too much of hardship but doesn’t enjoy the kind of flexibility afforded to   authorizers. “There is a lack of equivalency that is indisputable in terms of organizational arrangement you have different entities charged with the responsibility,” said David Arsen, a professor at Michigan State University who specialized in education policy and   administration. “In both instances one is relying on the integrity and the fidelity of the operations of the respective organizations. ” Still,   supporters in Michigan say there’s reason to have faith in the state’s authorizers. “Authorizers have really cleaned up their act. Very few problems that had been cited  two or three years ago —  if any —  exist anymore and nobody is talking about that,” said Eileen Lappin Weiser, a Republican member of the Michigan Board of Education who was recruited by Betsy DeVos to run for the position in 1998 and whose husband is a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party and an influential donor. In 2014, the Michigan Council for Charter School Authorizers announced plans to establish a voluntary authorizer accreditation system to ensure best practices were being followed, which signaled some hope. Only two of the state’s authorizers, however, have gone through with the process, and the 2016 legislation addressed accreditation minimally, only saying it was required if an authorizer wanted to open a new charter in Detroit. While Arsen notes that authorizers can still do a good job holding schools accountable, he emphasizes the necessity in Michigan creating statutes that assure authorizers are acting in taxpayers and children’s best interest. “Why,” he asked, “did it take 20 years to come up with features of charter accountability that still have so many loopholes?”"
53340,73523,Sessions Exaggerated His Record on Gun Prosecutions,Atlantic,Dan Friedman,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"In Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, opponents of new firearms restrictions have an attorney general nominee ready to implement their frequent call to “enforce the laws on the books. ” During his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Sessions pledged that, if his nomination is approved, he would take on the rising number of homicides in some American cities by deploying the weight of the federal courts against illegal firearms use. As proof of his commitment, he cited his own resume. “As United States Attorney, my office was a national leader in gun prosecutions nearly every year,” Sessions said in his opening remarks. Available records do not support that statement. The Justice Department does not maintain comprehensive public records on past prosecution trends. But the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, a database at Syracuse University that relies on Freedom of Information Act requests, has collected prosecution records dating to 1986. U. S. Attorneys choose the category that applies to each case, and there is no specific tally of gun prosecutions, which instead are counted under “weapons. ” Sessions served as the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama from 1981 until 1993. According to the TRAC database, between 1986 and 1990, his office did not prosecute a single defendant in what it counted as a weapons case. Many other U. S. Attorney offices also reported no weapons prosecutions during those years, but some reported dozens. In 1986, the Eastern District of Missouri prosecuted 37 weapons cases. In 1990, the Northern District of Illinois recorded 62 weapons prosecutions. In 1991, Sessions’s office prosecuted 31 weapons cases, placing it 29th, by volume, out of the 93 U. S. Attorney offices nationwide. In 1992 and 1993, Sessions and his team picked up the pace of weapons prosecutions, reporting 49 and 54 such cases, respectively. Those totals nonetheless did not move the Southern District of Alabama out of the middle of the pack. It’s possible that Sessions was referring during his confirmation testimony to his office’s per capita ranking. By that measure, the   district rises in the table, placing in the top five for gun prosecutions per person —  but only during those three years of Sessions   tenure. It was in overall prosecutions that the Southern District of Alabama was a clear national leader under Sessions, with a particular emphasis on drug cases. A report by the   Brennan Center for Justice argues that Sessions appeared to have “shifted resources toward drug offenses, but away from prosecuting violent crimes. ” The report notes that drug cases comprised 40 percent of convictions in Sessions’s district, while such cases made up just 20 percent of the convictions by the two other U. S. Attorney’s offices in Alabama during the same years. Spokespersons for Sessions and for   Donald Trump’s transition team did not respond to numerous requests to clarify the basis of Sessions’s claim regarding gun prosecutions. Senator Sessions declined to answer a reporter’s question as he left a Senate Republican lunch on Thursday. The sharp increase in weapons prosecutions in the early 1990s by Sessions’s office and many other U. S. Attorneys around the country appears to have flowed from an initiative known as Project Triggerlock. The effort was spearheaded by Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who served under President George H. W. Bush, to encourage federal prosecutors to prosecute gang members and drug offenders under federal weapons laws that carried stiff mandatory sentences. Of 31 gun cases Sessions’s office prosecuted in 1991, 29 came through Project Triggerlock. “I thought it was an effective thing, and we worked hard to prosecute those cases,” Sessions said of the program in a 2005 Senate floor speech. In his testimony on Tuesday, Sessions described Triggerlock as a predecessor to Project Exile, an effort started during the administration of President George W. Bush that likewise involved using federal gun laws to aggressively punish local criminals. Sessions explicitly recommended resurrecting those policies to reduce homicides in cities like Chicago and Baltimore that have seen sharp increases in shootings. “Properly enforced, the federal gun laws can reduce crime and violence in our cities and communities,” Sessions told the committee. Deploying longer sentences as a   strategy would mark a reversal of the trend toward   embraced in recent years by criminal justice reformers from both parties. “Just throwing a lot of people in jail is sort of moving back policing to an era that I thought we had moved past,” said David Chipman, a senior policy advisor at Americans for Responsible Solutions and a former ATF official who who investigated gun cases in Texas in the early 1990s. Chipman said that regardless of whether or not Sessions exaggerated his record as U. S. Attorney, “there is nothing that suggests he will not fully embrace this type of Triggerlock, Exile approach. ” Sessions’s enthusiasm  for federal gun prosecutions seems premised on the belief that longer sentences have a strong deterrent effect. “Criminals are most likely the kind of person that will shoot somebody when they go about their business,” he said during Tuesday’s hearing, “and if those people are not carrying guns because they believe they might go to federal court, be sent to a federal jail, for five years perhaps, they’ll stop carrying those guns during that drug dealing and their other activities that are criminal. Fewer people get killed. ” Emerging criminology research, however, indicates that it’s the swiftness and certainty of punishment, rather than the length or severity, that may have the greater effect on curbing dangerous conduct. And while Project Exile was linked to a drop in killings during the early days of the program, subsequent study has concluded that its   powers may have been illusory. Like many cities, Richmond, Virginia, suffered a spike in violent crime during the 1990s. In 1997, the city became the test site for Project Exile. In the program’s first year,   homicides in the city dropped 40 percent. But researchers now think the number of shootings probably would have fallen without the intervention of federal prosecutors. Other cities with similar populations and crime rates, including Norfolk, Virginia, recorded similar drops in crime rates, without adopting harsher federal penalties for offenders.

53341,73524,Why Elections Are Now Classified as ’Critical Infrastructure’,Atlantic,Kaveh Waddell,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Last Friday, the same day three of the top spy agencies in the U. S. released a summary of an investigation into Russia’s role in cyberattacks before the election, the Department of Homeland Security made a move that attracted less attention: It classified the elections process as “critical infrastructure,” putting it in a highly protected category alongside other vital elements of the country’s basic operations, like dams and the electrical grid. The classification will institutionalize the federal government’s role in helping state and local organizations secure the country’s elections, and makes it easier for DHS to offer them resources and intelligence information to that end. But tucked a few paragraphs into the official announcement was another key reason for the change: “The designation makes clear both domestically and internationally that election infrastructure enjoys all the benefits and protections of critical infrastructure that the U. S. government has to offer. ” Those “benefits and protections” might have something to do with keeping  elections   for foreign tampering. “One of the critical norms that we have garnered international support for is that no   will attack another country’s critical infrastructure in peacetime,” said Lisa Monaco, President Obama’s   adviser, at an event at the Aspen Institute on Friday. “Particularly with what we’ve seen over the last several months, we want to be clear that our electoral process is part of that infrastructure that we condemn —  hopefully on a bipartisan basis —  any foreign intervention into. ” Election systems will join a list of 16 other elements that make up the country’s critical infrastructure. But it’s too late for the designation to cover the 2016 election. In its investigation, the intelligence community found that Russian cyberattacks didn’t target or compromise “systems involved in vote tallying. ” But in the   to the election,   databases in nearly half of of U. S. states came under attack from foreign hackers, and four were breached, ABC News reported. Those intrusions were also suspected to be Russian in origin.   databases —  one of the parts of the election infrastructure that DHS has now designated as critical —  are usually connected to the internet, unlike voting machines themselves. Many voter databases were not protected or encrypted, Monaco said. The development of cyberwar norms is still in its early stages. Designating election systems as critical infrastructure, however, draws on a broader   standards of conduct: The same norms that deter an attack on a foreign country’s electrical grid would now cover electoral systems, too. But for nascent cyberwar norms to continue to solidify, Monaco said, the next administration will need to keep enforcing international standards by punishing states that violate them. She said that   Trump should be prepared to use tools like an executive order that Obama signed in April 2015, which authorizes the Treasury Department to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyberattacks. She characterized the executive order as a “loaded gun. ” “We have to be very clear that this activity will not stand,” Monaco said Friday. “It will not go unresponded to, and there will not be a free pass for malicious cyberactivity against our country. ”"
53342,73525,20th Century Women Is an Ode to Female Resilience,Atlantic,Sophie Gilbert,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"In a scene early on in 20th Century Women, Dorothea (Annette Bening) helps her son construct a birthday cake in the kitchen, plugging candles into a mess of whipped cream and strawberries. “Wait a few seconds and then bring it in,” she says, heading into the living room. Then, dutifully, she feigns surprise as he places it in front of her, while all the assembled guests sing “Happy Birthday. ” The nuances of Bening’s performance —  in just a few seconds, she communicates both the requisite efficiency and the sharp loneliness of single motherhood —  anchor 20th Century Women, Mike Mills’s paean to the women he grew up with. Set in Santa Barbara in 1979, it’s a charming, unfocused movie that acknowledges nostalgia but doesn’t wallow in it, capturing the emotional messiness of womanhood from the perspective of an outside observer,    Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann). Over the course of two hours, Jamie considers three different women in his life, while Dorothea considers the fact that, in growing up, he is turning into a creature who’s increasingly alien to her. What Sets the Smart Heroines of Hidden Figures Apart, The film is based, loosely, on Mills’s own experiences being raised by his mother and sister. (He tends to draw on his own life for inspiration: 2005’s Thumbsucker follows an anxious    coming of age, while 2010’s Beginners is about an adult man whose father comes out as gay late in life, as Mills’s father did.) Dorothea, feeling that she knows Jamie less each day, enlists the help of two women, Abbie (Greta Gerwig) a photographer immersed in the emerging punk scene, and Julie (Elle Fanning) a friend of Jamie’s whom he’s besotted with. Jamie narrates brief portraits of each woman, each very much a product of her time and place: the year they were born, the books they read, their hopes and dreams. And Dorothea, in turn, considers Jamie, how she can help him become a good man, and what that even means at a time when the strictures of masculinity are evolving so quickly. If that sounds yawningly idealistic, it’s buffeted by a wicked sense of humor and Mills’s distinctive visual approach, honed during  his years making music videos and TV ads. Jamie describes characters as the camera glances through the detritus of their lives: Dorothea’s Birkenstocks and Salem cigarettes, Abbie’s   pills and tattered red shoes, Julie’s Judy Blume novels and   sessions. This approach adds depth to the characters that often bests simple description. While we learn a fair amount about William (Billy Crudup) Dorothea’s lodger, from her description of his history, we learn infinitely more in the moment where he professes to Abbie that he makes his own shampoo. The most surprising part of the movie is how well Mills writes his three women, and how accurately he pinpoints their very distinct anxieties, aided by three spectacular performers. As the fiercely independent Dorothea, who was raised in the Depression, Bening is magnificent and unflappable, accepting her son’s various experiments with indomitable spirit, but also revealing the loneliness that keeps her up at night. Gerwig, an endlessly versatile actor, shows Abbie’s toughness and vulnerability along with her frustration at being stifled by the limits of life in Santa Barbara. Fanning’s Julie is sweet and complex, mistaking the freedom to act out with freedom itself. But Zumann’s Jamie matches all three with his sensitivity and awkward attempts at masculinity, reading Abbie’s feminist manifestos and lecturing surly boys at the skate park on clitoral stimulation. He’s so emotionally intelligent and so curious that it’s hard to share Dorothea’s concerns for his future, which stunts the dramatic tension of the movie just a little. Mostly, it’s a pleasure to be in the company of the engaging misfits living in Dorothea’s vast, crumbling house, and to remember flashes of what it felt like to be encountering adulthood in all its perplexities. Mills creates a strong sense of the late ’70s via music (Black Flag and the Talking Heads) clothing, cars, and political flashpoints (Jimmy Carter’s “crisis of confidence” speech features in one scene) but the most nostalgic element of the movie might stem from how familiar his characters can feel:   women in all their adaptable, resilient glory."
53343,73526,The End of Government Oversight?,Atlantic,Alexia Fernández Campbell,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Regulations, regulations, regulations. It’s a dirty word among Republicans in Congress, who are getting started on their plan to scale back federal oversight of U. S. businesses. Federal rules meant to protect the environment, consumers, and workers can cost businesses money, and Republicans believe those rules are strangling American economic growth. Republicans have repeatedly accused the Obama administration of abusing its regulatory powers, such as the Labor Department’s creation of the fiduciary rule (which requires financial planners to put the interest of their clients before their own) and the overtime rule (which increases the number of workers eligible for overtime pay). As president, Trump can remove these rules, though doing so would likely take years. Congressional Republicans want to go beyond that, making it as hard as possible for the executive branch to create new regulations. “We’re going to take a fresh approach, we don’t want bureaucracy touching everything,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday at an event at the Hoover Institution. In his role, McCarthy sets the agenda for the House, and the   frenzy has already started. Their biggest effort is through passage of the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2017 (known as the REINS Act) which was approved last week by the House. The bill gives Congress the power to approve or deny regulations enacted by federal agencies that are expected to have an economic cost of more than $100 million, which means Congress has the final word. To understand what the implications of this would be in practice, such a law would have likely killed a rule like the Clean Power Plan, which the Environmental Protection Agency finalized last year to limit   pollution from America’s power plants. Extensive scientific reviews have concluded that   emissions cause climate change. Under the REINS Act, such a rule would only have gone into effect if Congress voted in favor of it within 70 days of its creation. If Congress had chosen not to vote on it, it would not have gone into effect. (It’s important to note, however, that even without the REINS Act, implementation of the Clean Power Plan has been delayed pending the outcomes of federal litigation.) Then there’s the Regulatory Accountability Act, which sailed through the House Wednesday. The bill would require the executive branch to craft regulations that cost the least to achieve the intended result. Aside from these two bills, lawmakers are also coming up with a list of   rules they want to jettison under the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress authority to vote on removing regulations issued by the White House in the past six months. That puts several new rules at risk, such as those aimed at preventing coal companies from polluting streams used for drinking water, increasing the number of employees eligible for overtime pay, and curbing methane emissions from oil and gas producers. In McCarthy’s ideal world, Congress will undo most regulations issued in the past six months, and the two   bills will easily be approved by the Senate and then head off to be  signed by President Trump. This is not a   scenario. While that may be a relatively clear path, another area of policy is turning out to be more contentious than anticipated: infrastructure spending. At Thursday’s event, McCarthy expressed skepticism about spending money on building and repairing roads and bridges —  something Trump has vowed to do as president. McCarthy said he doesn’t want to spend money on expensive projects that take so long to complete that only his children would see them finished. “We have to remember that we have a [budget] deficit in this country,” McCarthy said. Though he didn’t say he would oppose an infrastructure spending bill, his hesitance is a blow to what has been viewed as one area where Republicans and Democrats can find common ground. Outnumbered by Republicans in Congress, Democrats will have little power to stop the   efforts. But it’s unclear whether removing regulations will have the impact on economic growth that Republicans anticipate. Many economists believe that productivity growth (not government oversight) is the biggest factor in growing the economy. Increasing productivity would require a level of   innovation that hasn’t been seen in 50 years, when the shipping container was invented and made it easier to ship goods around the world, says economist Marc Levinson. At the same time, removing government rules will be a boon to some businesses, even if not the economy as a whole. And those business, of course, are quite eager for the Republicans to succeed in their efforts."

But that description understates both the breadth of DeVos’s political interests and the influence she wields as part of her powerful family.

53345,73528,Breitbart Alumni Launch ’Populist-Nationalist’ Group,Atlantic,Rosie Gray,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Patrick Howley, a former Breitbart News reporter, left the site under vague circumstances back in November. Howley told me at the time that he was leaving of his own volition because the site had become more “controlled” after the departure of Steve Bannon, the organization’s former chairman who was hired for a top job in the Trump campaign and will be the White House’s chief strategist in the incoming administration. Now, however, Howley and other Breitbart News alumni are starting their own group designed to enforce Trump’s agenda, combined with a planned media arm. So far, the group, which they are calling the America First Project, has surfaced in the press for trying to unseat the current chairman of the Florida Republican Party, who is seen by some Trump allies as having been untrustworthy during the election. Its existence is still more nominal than real. But the move by Breitbart alumni to form their own group indicates that ideological factions are already taking shape within the Trumpist   movement, even before its leader takes office. Howley has made the rounds of the conservative media world in Washington, having done stints at   publications like The Daily Caller and the Washington Free Beacon as well as Breitbart, where he was suspended for a time last year after publicly questioning his  ’s account of being manhandled by Trump’s campaign manager at a press conference. He said he envisions the project as an “advocacy organization that is going to advocate for Trump administration policies that generally fall under a   window. ” (He doesn’t primarily use the word “conservative. ” Howley has lost patience with the conservative movement’s focus on cutting spending and entitlement reform. “Conservatives are not offering any solutions, all they’re doing is cutting government benefits,” he said.) In Howley’s view, Breitbart has lost its street cred by trying to go mainstream, and it no longer provides a voice for the “populist nationalist” movement that Trump represents. “Breitbart’s dropping the ball in term of explaining what all of this is about,” Howley said. He’s not pleased, for example, that the site hired John Carney from The Wall Street Journal to lead business and economics coverage. “They’re going in a direction that I don’t think is interesting. I think it’s boring,” he said. “After Steve [Bannon] left, the people who are in charge of it now are more interested in being a mainstream organization that has credibility in the eyes of people who read The Wall Street Journal,” he said. Dustin Stockton, another former Breitbart reporter who will serve as chief strategist for the group, was more measured, describing their relationship with their former organization as “really good. ” Howley wouldn’t say whether Bannon is aware of or has given his blessing to their group. “You’d have to ask him,” he said. “Bannon is somebody who is a contact of ours in the administration and he’s always believed in me and he’s always believed in Dustin. ” Bannon left Breitbart News after joining the Trump campaign in August. “I imagine there will be lots of competition to Breitbart, as there should be —  it’s healthy,” Bannon said of the new group. “I’m still struck by how those on the left have not come up with a progressive version that goes after the Democratic establishment. ” Howley plans an investigative outfit called Big League Politics as the media arm of his project, though Stockton said the launch for that site was some time away. The group has also brought on board Jen Lawrence, another former Breitbart reporter (and also Stockton’s girlfriend) as well as Bruce Carter, an activist who ran a   Sanders group called Black Men For Bernie. Stockton said Lee Stranahan, a longtime Breitbart News writer, would informally advise the group while continuing to write for Breitbart. “A rising tide lifts all boats, so I view Donald Trump’s victory in November as a rejection of establishment media and a chance for a  wave of new media outlets to provide reporting and energize activism,” Stranahan said. “Breitbart’s enormous new audience gets news from a variety of outlets already and I think Dustin, Jen and their team will be able to provide more of the kind of journalism that Breitbart readers appreciate. ” Stockton said the group will be structured for now through an already extant (albeit  ) PAC called the Western Representation PAC in order to be able to launch quickly. Stockton is still working out the details of how the group will be legally structured, but for now it will be a “hybrid PAC”: a traditional political action committee operating in tandem with a super PAC. Stockton’s background is in the tea party groups of the early 2010s, and he was a reporter for Breitbart News until shortly after this election. His new group has an email list of around 200, 000 addresses, Stockton said, to raise   donations, though they say they want big donors as well. Stockton would not identify which donors they are talking to. They have set a fundraising goal of $8 to $10 million in the first year. One idea being kicked around is that donors could receive “Trump Enforcement Posse” or “Trump Enforcement Team” badges, a proposal that encapsulates the group’s ambitions and approach. Howley and Stockton have devised a series of escalating “pressure points” that they will use against members of Congress and other members of the “permanent political class” who they believe must be brought in line with Trump’s agenda. Stockton laid them out in an email: STAGE 1: Whipping votes on legislation by facilitating constituent to member contacts, STAGE 2: Deploying DC reporter team to question any members who   STAGE 3: Deploying   team to ambush in DC or in   STAGE 4: Engagement with local activists and local media through   media, STAGE 5: Development of comprehensive opposition research file, STAGE 6: Organize local protests, town hall confrontations, and other grassroots action, STAGE 7: Promotion of potential opponents, creation of independent expenditure campaign, STAGE 8: Replace bad guys with good guys, Howley and Stockton described a program of “ambush interviews” and “  tactics” designed to enforce cooperation with Trump’s priorities. The issues they’re focusing on include some signature Trump proposals —  the wall, protectionist trade policy —  and some that are a little bit more outside the bounds of what is considered mainstream, even in this new era, such as “vaccine safety. ” Trump has signaled his openness to vaccine conspiracy theorists, meeting this week with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who believes that there is a link between vaccines and autism (a theory that has been debunked by researchers). Stockton and Howley said they had contacted Kennedy about vaccines. Reached by phone, Kennedy said he didn’t recall being in contact with them. “I’m not familiar with those people but it doesn’t mean I didn’t see them at a speech or somewhere,” he said. “I can’t say I’ve ever met them, I’m not familiar with them and not familiar with the organization. ” Like Trump himself, they show a certain ideological flexibility when it comes to the split between the left and right. Stockton said they are “looking to add several   people on the left,” and Carter’s presence on the team represents an overture to recalcitrant Sanders supporters. But their primary goal is ideological enforcement on the right. Maybe Trumpism would have had more cohesion, in fact, if Trump had lost now that the project has succeeded, it has the time and energy for infighting. “Now that we’ve saved the republic and protected our sovereignty, we can start having ideological arguments,” Howley said."
53346,73529,Why Conservative Politicians May Be More Attractive Than Liberal Ones,Atlantic,Clare Foran,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Conservative politicians are better looking than liberal politicians on average in the United States, Europe, and Australia —  and that might create an overall advantage for conservative parties, according to a study published in the February issue of the   Journal of Public Economics. The study goes on to suggest that the more attractive a politician is, the more likely voters across the political spectrum are to assume he or she is conservative, while the less attractive a politician is, the more likely voters are to assume he or she is liberal. Prior research indicates that   political candidates win more votes, just one of the many ways attractive individuals seem to have it better in life. There is evidence to suggest that beautiful people are viewed by others as more likable, trustworthy and competent, and may be more likely to land job interviews and earn more money than less attractive people to name just a few advantages. To determine the political consequences of voters preferring attractive candidates, researchers at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Sweden and the Ifo Institute in Germany set out to find which parties were populated with more attractive politicians. After tallying up the results of surveys evaluating the attractiveness of politicians in the United States, Europe and Australia, researchers found that conservative politicians in all three places ranked as more attractive on average. In the United States, these results might mean that GOP candidates have an advantage over Democrats in elections simply because they tend to be better looking. “Politicians on the right are more beautiful than politicians on the left in Europe, the United States, and Australia,” the authors of the study write, adding that “their beauty advantage, all else equal, makes candidates on the right more likely to win office and implement their preferred policies. ” The study, titled The right look: Conservative politicians look better and voters reward it, goes on to argue that conservative politicians are not only considered more attractive on average, but also derive more benefit from that perception than liberal politicians who are similarly attractive. Specifically, the study found that attractive conservative politicians won more votes than attractive liberal politicians in elections when voters didn’t know much about the candidates. It proposes that one potential explanation for why attractive conservative candidates win more votes is because conservative and liberal voters alike assume that more attractive candidates lean conservative. As a result, attractive conservative candidates might receive an added boost by winning votes from conservative voters who believe the candidate is more likely to stand up for conservative values, while some liberal voters might be less inclined to vote for attractive liberal candidates since they may assume the candidates are conservative or at least lean that way in terms of ideological preference. Further supporting the idea that voters associate good looks with conservatism, researchers asked respondents to guess which political party politicians represented based on a photograph. They found that conservative politicians who were correctly guessed to be conservative were on average more attractive than conservative politicians that respondents did not correctly identify as conservative. “The more   a candidate, the more he or she is thought to stand to the right,” one of the study authors Professor Panu Poutvaara of the University of Munich and Ifo Institute, said in   adding: “This connection holds among both liberal and conservative voters. ” The research suggests voters on both the left and the right use beauty as a kind of mental shortcut when deciding how to vote in scenarios where they don’t know much about the candidates. “Voters indeed use beauty as a cue for candidate ideology,” the authors write in the study. So why would conservative politicians be more attractive on average in the United States, Europe and Australia? The study offers a possible explanation, arguing that as a result of the monetary advantages and general privilege conferred by good looks, attractive people may be more likely to end up identifying as conservatives. According to the researchers: A simple economic explanation of the appearance gap in favor of the right is that beautiful people earn more money, and the more people earn, the more they are inclined to oppose redistribution and, arguably, to support, get active in, and represent parties to the right. A more general psychological explanation could be that   people are more likely to perceive the world as a just place, since they are treated better than others, and are happier, and a frequent reason for people to sympathize with the left is a perception of the world as unfair. The research is not an exhaustive study of conservative parties, candidates and voting behavior. In studying politicians in the United States, for example, researchers only looked at candidates running in elections dating from 1995 to 2008, and excluded Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton from their analysis. Given their   respondents might recognize both politicians and not be able to provide an unbiased assessment. The conclusions of the study are not definitive. The suggestion that attractive people are more likely to be conservative because they earn more money and see the world as a more just place is only one possible attempt at explaining the conclusions of the study. And the notion that attractive people gravitate towards conservatism seems to run counter to the liberal streak running through Hollywood. If nothing else, the research suggests that the outcome of elections can be influenced by superficial qualities, though it also suggests that voters associate those superficial qualities with particular ideological leanings. It’s a reminder that the reasons why an individual votes for a political candidate may be far from  ."
53347,73530,Black-ish’s ’Lemons’ Is Art for the Age of Trump,Atlantic,Megan Garber,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"What will the Trump presidency mean for the nation’s artistic output? Will the United States’s new Commander in Chief, who has been by turns part of the entertainment industry and a mocker of it, inspire creators in their endeavors? Will he deter them? “In dark times,” David Foster Wallace mused, “the definition of good art would seem to be art that locates and applies CPR to those elements of what’s human and magical that still live and glow despite the times’ darkness. ” While these times, of course, are not dark for everyone, for those for whom they are —  for the Americans who are confused and angry and fearful about the new course of the nation —  it’s an open question: What will art look like in the years to come? Will it protest? Will it grapple? Will it retreat? Here’s an early entry in the canon of   art, one that might well offer a clue to all that: “Lemons,” the episode of   that aired on ABC on Wednesday night. The episode takes that humblest of things —  the primetime TV sitcom —  and uses it to find, per Wallace’s mandate, the human magic of this moment. “Lemons” (the title is both a reference to, and a rejection of, the old adage about making lemonade) is art that is supremely aware of its own ability not just to reflect the world, but to help people make sense of it. It is art that achieves the neatest of tricks: It expresses anger while also insisting on empathy. “Lemons” is set two months after the 2016 election —  which is to say, this episode of   is happening   —  and it finds the Johnsons each, in their own way, coping with the aftereffects of Trump’s upset victory. (“America has a love affair with upsets,” Dre notes in the episode’s opening monologue. But “what happens when the winners and losers are supposed to be on the same team? ”) Dre, for his part, is trying to move on from the events of early November, focusing his attention —  or, at any rate, trying to focus his attention —  on a big pitch at work. Bow, on the other hand, is taking refuge in activism. (“Everything you’re wearing is from an NPR commercial!” Dre tells her, as he takes in his wife’s Black Lives Matter button, Habitat for Humanity sweatpants, and UNICEF  .) Jack is determined to be optimistic. (“I don’t see this glass as   I see it as half full!” he exclaims, while staring at a vessel that is actually 1) a bowl and 2) empty.) Junior, with the help of Pops, is working on a monologue that he will deliver at Valley Glen Prep’s appointed Healing Day —  a recitation of Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech. (“Lemons,” fittingly, is airing directly before the national holiday that celebrates King’s legacy the iconic speech runs like a refrain through the episode.) And then there’s Zoey, who busies herself making, yes, lemonade. Bow, confused and a bit dismayed by her daughter’s evident impulse toward escapism —  she suggests that maybe Zoey should take a few minutes to make calls on behalf of Planned Parenthood instead —  attempts to ascribe political meaning to Zoey’s   effort. “I get it —  the country gave us lemons, and you make lemonade,” Bow says. Or maybe it’s more like Beyoncé, she says —  how “she uses lemonade as a symbol for women, and their   and healing. ” Later, though, Zoey explains herself. “It’s not liberal lemonade, it’s not conservative lemonade,” she tells her mother. “It’s just lemonade —  that I made with love. That’s what I want my contribution to be. Love. ”     and How to Talk to Kids About Police Brutality, Lemonade, in other words, isn’t just the political power of things that can be shared, apolitically it’s also the extremely varied ways people have of coping with the world and its surprises. Someone zigs. Another zags. It’s unpredictable. It’s chaotic. These characters, after all, are in mourning. And mourning is as individualized a thing as it is an unpredictable one. At Dre’s work, too, everyone is reacting to things just a little bit differently. People are distracted, but in slightly different ways. In one set piece, “there is no way we’re getting any work done today” gets repeated in the Stevens  Lido conference room as November 9 becomes December 9 becomes January 9. People are angry, and looking for someone else to blame. (On a whiteboard in the firm’s conference room is scrawled a question —  “Whose fault is this?” under which is written, alternately, “THE GAYS       THE BLACKS   WHITE WOMEN. ” Each   has been crossed out as the workers realize that fault cannot be neatly assigned.) At one particularly powerful moment, Lucy, the firm’s litigious employee, makes a confession: She voted for Trump. Not because she likes him or agreed with the claims and threats he made during the campaign, she says, but because she gave Obama a chance —  twice —  and hasn’t seen her life get much better. “It’s eight years later, my dad’s still out of work, my hometown is about to go under,” Lucy tells her colleagues, “and Hillary comes out saying she’s basically going to keep everything the same. ” Lucy was conflicted about her vote. But she wanted to shake up the system. Her colleagues hear that. They don’t agree with her. But they hear her. “Lemons,” in general, takes for granted that its viewers will share the politics of its characters: The episode figures that, when Bow tells Zoey that “as a mom, it is my job to deliver a world where the values that I raised you to believe matter,” those are values that are, in broad ways as well as narrow ones, shared by  ’s viewers. And yet this is a piece of TV that is acutely aware of the dangers of filter bubbles, and that isn’t satisfied with simply reflecting half of the country back to itself. “Lemons,” its    title notwithstanding, is trying to understand. It is giving someone like Lucy a voice, and a hearing. It is giving those things, too, to Dre, who finally loses his temper when Mr. Stevens accuses him of apathy: “I love this country,” Dre retorts —  “even though, at times, it doesn’t love me back. ” And then Dre gives a summary of the civil rights movement, as archival images and footage fill the screen in a montage, and “Strange Fruit” —  the song made especially powerful because it is Nina Simone’s achingly taut rendition —  plays as a score. Dre talks about striving, in spite of injustice. He talks about hoping, in spite of history. He concludes, “I love this country, as much, if not more, than you do, and don’t you ever forget that. ” It was a scene in a sitcom that was also a history lesson that was also a plea for empathy. It was a validation of what TV —  particularly network TV, with its relative ability to summon wide and varied audiences —  can accomplish, even as culture fragments, even as Americans threaten to   themselves away from empathy. Kenya Barris,  ’s creator and showrunner, has generally resisted, he has said, the soapboxery of the Very Special Episode vein.   may have had episodes that overtly doubled, like “Lemons,” as cultural commentary —  “Hope,” “40 Acres and a Vote” —  but “we don’t like to say ‘these are the topics,’” Barris told TV Guide in September. He and his   preferred a more organic approach to merging their fictions with the truths of the world beyond. The 2016 election, however, changed that. “From Tuesday night to Wednesday morning, I think my show changed,” Barris told NPR’s Rachel Martin of the events that turned November 8 into November 9. In the aftermath of the election, Barris said, We sort of calmed down and we were like, you know what? We have to talk about things that people might not want to talk about openly. But we have to dig in deeper and stay later and have more real conversations and argue amongst ourselves more and really bring our emotions to the surface and really say things that people want to hear. .. We have to do that more. We have a responsibility. It’s not just TV for us anymore. It’s not just TV. It’s art."
53348,73531,What Weird Obama Dreams Say About the President’s Legacy,Atlantic,Will Di Novi,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"For the past eight years, Americans have been dreaming of Barack Obama, and not just in an aspirational sense. At every step in his presidential journey, people across the United States have been seeing him in their sleep —  in rapturous fantasies,   nightmares, and all sorts of weird situations in between. This phenomenon first came to light during the 2008 primaries, when the novelist Sheila Heti solicited dreams about the Democratic candidates on a website called The Metaphysical Poll. As hundreds of dreamers submitted reports, the dreams about Obama gradually outnumbered the dreams about Hillary Clinton and painted a glowing portrait of the Illinois Senator. Dream Obama was a loyal husband and a generous friend, a     and a   lover. “At a time when no one knew who was going to win the Democratic Primaries, I was certain it was going to be Obama,” Heti remembers. “I had seen the dreams. ” She closed The Metaphysical Poll on June 10, 2008, three days after Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee. But the site’s spirit lives on in the work of Kelly Bulkeley, a psychologist of religion at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. While completing American Dreamers, a book about the dream lives of American voters, Bulkeley became an enthusiastic supporter of Heti’s project. In 2009, he launched his own Sleep and Dream Database, a digital archive where he has continued to gather Obama dreams over the past eight years, amassing the internet’s largest curated collection. With each sleepy glimpse of this former “dream candidate,” Bulkeley has gained new evidence to support his conviction, developed over 20 books, that there is “an     dimension of dreaming. ” This is a novel concept in the history of dream research, where psychologists dating back to Freud have typically viewed dreams as   with little relevance outside the personal wishes of the dreamer. Bulkeley and other contemporary researchers see things differently. They argue that a person’s dreams, when compared to others’ on a large enough scale, can also have collective significance, reflecting concerns shared by communities. Obama’s nocturnal cameos throughout his presidency have served as an exciting test case for this   theory of dreaming, and internet dream banks have provided the data to back it up. * * * Through much of American history, the most reliable proof that people dream about the country’s political system came from those who ran it. John Adams and Benjamin Rush used to parse each other’s dreams for insights into their political rivals. Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson reported recurring nightmares during their years in office. When the first sleep laboratories opened in the 1950s, researchers could start to document the political dreams of ordinary citizens. Now, between Bulkeley’s database and the online Dream Bank run by the psychologist G. William Domhoff, you can find historical dream reports about every sitting president since World War II. Harry Truman cuts a sly figure on the sleepy streets of the Midwest. LBJ ruins delicious sex dreams. Dreams about politicians can be studied in unprecedented numbers and searched through with unprecedented speed. When Bulkeley launched his database in 2009, he archived 100 Obama dreams from Heti’s site.  Eight years, and two terms, later, Obama continues to appear among the more than 20, 000 dream reports on the site, showing up in dream diaries, opinion surveys, and psychological experiments. These carefully vetted entries from mostly academic sources are considerably more reliable than the Obama dreams on   sites like YouTube, Reddit, and Dreamjournal. net, which, numerous as they may be, have not been recorded in a transparent and systematic manner. For every dreamer in Bulkeley’s Database who has shared a steamy Oval Office rendezvous, there may be other Americans too bashful or forgetful to accurately record their own. If gathered scrupulously, and supplemented with information about the dreamers, Obama dreams have the potential to offer a “lovely, uncontrolled example of how the president was imagined,” says Gary Alan Fine, a sociologist at Northwestern University. Fine studies the historical reputations of American public figures and shares Bulkeley’s belief that dreams are more than just reflections of the self. When historians turn to Obama dreams in the years to come, it will not be for their “esoteric symbolism,” he predicts, but for what “the dreams tell us about American politics. ” * * * Though outnumbered by conservatives in the electorate, liberals appear to dominate the dream life of the nation.   volunteers typically skew    and an intriguing body of research shows that liberals are more active dreamers than conservatives. In one 2011 study for the journal Dreaming, for instance, Bulkeley surveyed thousands of American adults who identified as either conservative or liberal and found that his conservative subjects were, in the study’s words, “slightly better sleepers and relatively minimal dreamers,” while his liberal participants had higher rates of dream recall and “more expansive” dreams. The Obama dreams at his Sleep and Dream Database reflect these trends, vividly documenting liberals’ evolving views of the president over the past eight years. In the early dreams, Obama is a figure of messianic powers, resolving disputes, levitating objects, and, in one eerily prophetic dream, ripping off Osama Bin Laden’s fingers with his teeth. Around the time of the 2010 midterms, he begins to succumb to the political crises that the dreamers were following in the news. A    woman from Washington State dreams of a sinister conspiracy involving “GM and the big oil companies,” who are staging the BP Oil Spill to make Obama look bad. A 2011 report shows a    dreamer reacting to the news that his wife “doesn’t think she likes Obama any more. ” Obama continues to struggle in dreams from his second term. He is insulted at social gatherings and shows up to a speech “crippled and in a wheelchair. ” But even as Obama has been worn down by the rigors of the presidency, Bulkeley’s liberal subjects have maintained their fondness for the man behind the institution. They dream of drinking beers with him at parties. They dream of meeting him for lunch dates. As one of Bulkeley’s longtime subjects, an East Coast liberal, puts it in a dream report from 2015: “[Obama] acknowledges my presence in some way. . .. His presence is strong. ” That intimate bond was still on display in an   dream survey that Bulkeley commissioned with YouGov in May. Obama dreams showed up among the feverish visions of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and highlighted the conflicted feelings that many subjects had toward the presidential contenders. The Clinton dreams often depicted a committed public servant and “a good listener,” but they “had none of the mystical halo of wonder and awe that people felt around Obama,” Bulkeley recalls. The dreams about Trump “were almost like the evil twins of the Obama dreams”: The Republican candidate projected strength and confidence, and appeared in dreams with greater frequency than Clinton, but dreamers on both ends of the political spectrum tended to describe him in negative terms (“unfriendly,” “a jerk,” “a raving megalomaniac”) according to Bulkeley. Amid a strange and unpredictable campaign, Dream Obama was, comparatively speaking, a calm and consistent presence. * * * Every dream researcher I’ve interviewed has attributed this nocturnal staying power to Obama’s visibility in the media. “Our modern global connectivity intensifies the effect of us all seeing the same images,” says Deirdre Barrett, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School. “These daytime experiences are what our dream life is built from. ” As the first American President elected in the   age, Obama has had his image consumed more frequently, and shared more widely, than any of his predecessors. This raises a tantalizing question: Is he the most   president in American history? It is a point “that dream research can’t yet confirm with a whole lot of confidence,” Bulkeley says. There is not enough control data to compare presidential dreaming across administrations, and dreaming is such an intensely private experience that its social dimensions will always be hard to quantify. Online databases may eventually allow researchers to study the most esoteric dream content in large data sets, and to organize that data with incredible speed, but Big Dream Data is still in its infancy. For now, Bulkeley’s work remains “an inductive process. ” He notices the relative frequency of certain kinds of dreams and then tries to amass enough dream reports to discern meaningful patterns in their content. As I gathered dream data to compare with Bulkeley’s reports, I tracked down a dozen Obama dreamers via dream boards and   platforms: a farmer in Ohio, a   provider in Texas, and a copywriter in Los Angeles, to name a few, along with dreamers from Australia and Canada. This was hardly a comprehensive survey of the political dreamscape, but it supported Bulkeley’s observation, dating back to The Metaphysical Poll, that people who are willing to share their Obama dreams are mostly    voters with positive views of the president. Even as the Americans I spoke with have grown apart from Obama on issues like drone warfare or   reform, he has remained a sympathetic presence in their dreams. He has offered advice to their Republican spouses. He has gently deflected their sexual advances. He has picked their outfits for important job interviews, then fixed them eggs and coffee for the road. For some dreamers, these have been regular appearances, occurring once or twice a year throughout his presidency for others, there was a single, unforgettable encounter. In 25 years of studying dreams about politicians, Bulkeley has never seen another figure who more clearly supports his hypothesis that a person’s “frequency of appearance in people’s dreams is an index of their charisma. ” Obama’s successor has his own, highly polarizing brand of charisma, and Bulkeley predicts “many people over the next few years are going to have dreams and nightmares about [Trump]. ” Perhaps wary of the long nights that await them, the Obama dreamers I spoke with grew nostalgic as they revisited their sleeping encounters with America’s departing president. In Obama’s final days in office, they’re embracing the same outlook as a dreamer from Bulkeley’s site who once looked on in beleaguered wonder as Dream Obama bolted off down a shoreline filled with crocodiles: “I found a lot of things wrong or risky in the things he did. But he’s Obama, it doesn’t matter. ”"
53349,73532,Why Is Obama Expanding Surveillance Powers Right Before He Leaves Office?,Atlantic,Kaveh Waddell,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"On Thursday, the Obama administration finalized new rules that allow the National Security Agency to share information it gleans from its vast international surveillance apparatus with the 16 other agencies that make up the U. S. intelligence community. With the new changes, which were long in the works, those agencies can apply for access to various feeds of raw, undoctored NSA intelligence. Analysts will then be able to sift through the contents of those feeds as they see fit, before implementing required privacy protections. Previously, the NSA applied those privacy protections itself, before forwarding select pieces of information to agencies that might need to see them. The updated procedures will multiply the number of intelligence analysts who have access to NSA surveillance, which is captured in large quantities and often isn’t subject to warrant requirements. The changes rankled privacy advocates, who oppose a broadening of surveillance powers —  especially on the cusp of Donald Trump’s inauguration. Trump and Mike Pompeo, the  ’s nominee for CIA director, have made it clear that they think overzealous   protections should be cleared away in favor of stronger surveillance laws. But while the changes may subject more Americans to warrantless surveillance, the   timing of the announcement actually might have been designed to cut future privacy losses. Susan Hennessey, a Brookings fellow and the managing editor of Lawfare, says firming up the changes before Trump takes office makes it harder for the incoming president to encroach even further on civil liberties. I spoke with Hennessey, who was previously an attorney in the NSA general counsel’s office, about the lasting effects of the new   procedures. A transcript of our conversation follows, lightly edited for clarity and concision. Kaveh Waddell: First off, what do these changes mean for the intelligence community? Has a lack of   among agencies been holding back investigations? Susan Hennessey: The origin of these changes dates back, honestly, to just after  . There was this identified issue of “stovepiping”: Intelligence wasn’t being shared frequently or fast enough. Some modifications have already been made throughout the years. Under Executive Order 12333 as it previously existed, NSA analysts had to make an initial determination and apply a set of privacy rules before sharing raw   information with other parts of the intelligence community. After this change, it doesn’t necessarily have to be an NSA analyst that makes that determination —  that information can be shared with other parts of the intelligence community. So it doesn’t change the substantive rules, it doesn’t change the scope of collection, it doesn’t change the types of protection, it doesn’t change the possible uses it essentially just broadens the group of people who can apply those protections to the raw intelligence. Waddell: And by extension, it broadens the group of people who get to see raw intelligence, before those rules are applied? Hennessey: Yes. This is something that has been at the forefront of privacy and   advocates’ minds when they’ve expressed concern with this type of collection. But it’s not accurate to say the rule change means it’s a raw      that anybody can get signals intelligence. Intelligence agencies other than the NSA will have to provide justification for why they need access to that data. It can only be for foreign intelligence, or other enumerated purposes. So it’s not that those agencies will just be able to see whatever they want —  it’s that they will be able to request, with particular justifications, access to more raw signals intelligence than they had before. Then, they will need to apply those minimization procedures for themselves. The   concern often surrounds the use of incidentally collected information. Under the new rule, the FBI could not obtain access to or search raw intelligence information for ordinary criminals in an ordinary criminal investigation against a U. S. person. However, if the FBI incidentally seized evidence of a crime, they are allowed to use that information. So that tends to be where the tension is for people who are concerned with the potential impacts that this change could have on U. S. persons. Waddell: The fact that more Americans could potentially be subject to warrantless searches, just by virtue of being caught up in the raw signals intelligence that’s shared —  is that something that concerns you? Hennessey: No. Look, I think it’s important to understand that these minimization procedures are taken very seriously, and all other agencies that are handling raw signals intelligence are essentially going to have to import these very complex oversight and compliance mechanisms that currently exist at the NSA. Within the NSA, those are extremely strong and protective mechanisms. I think people should feel reassured that the rules cannot be violated —  certainly not without it coming to the attention of oversight and compliance bodies. I am confident that all of the agencies in the U. S. intelligence community will discharge those very same obligations with the same level of diligence and rigor, adhering to both the spirit and the letter of the law. That said, there are potentially broader reforms that might be undertaken. I don’t think that they necessarily need to be linked to the sharing of data. But it’s reasonable to at least engage in a conversation about whether or not it’s appropriate to have particular   reforms, like for example imposing an obligation for law enforcement to obtain a warrant in particular circumstances. That’s a long way of saying that nothing about this particular rule change exposing Americans to additional privacy risks. However, that doesn’t mean that there are not still reasonable and responsible reforms which might take place. Waddell: I found it interesting that you said the change could, in one way, actually be viewed as a “huge source of comfort. ” I think you were referring to the timing of the change. Why is that? Hennessey: These changes have actually been in process for eight or nine years. One of the things that I think individuals who had insight into intelligence activities and were concerned about the election of Donald Trump —  specifically, some of the statements he’s made about adherence to the rule of law —  a lot of those people’s minds went very quickly to these procedures. It’s important to understand the distinction between Executive Order 12333 and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: One very oversimplified way to think about it is that FISA is a statute that governs collection that takes place within the United States, but that is aimed at a foreign target 12333 collection is aimed at a foreign target, and takes place outside the United States. That’s shorthand that glosses over some technical and legal nuance, but those are the broad buckets people should be thinking about. FISA is a statute, so you’d need congressional action to change those rules, and you have a   check there. But 12333 is not constrained by statute it’s constrained by executive order. In theory, a president could change an executive order —  that’s within his constitutional power. It’s not as easy as just a pen stroke, but it’s theoretically possible. Executive Order 12333 requires that this series of protective procedures exist and are adhered to. The procedures are kind of where the rubber meets the road on privacy. They’re the details, the  : What can you actually see? What can you share? What do you have to minimize? So they’re really, really important in terms of what the relationship between U. S. citizens and the intelligence community looks like. When they were in rewrites, they were sort of vulnerable. There was the possibility that an incoming administration would say, “Hey! While you’re in the process of rewriting, let’s go ahead and adjust some of the domestic protections. ” And I think a reasonable observer might assume that while the protections the Obama administration was interested in putting into place increased privacy protections —  or at the very least did not reduce them —  that the incoming administration has indicated that they are less inclined to be less protective of privacy and civil liberties. So I think it is a good sign that these procedures have been finalized, in part because it’s so hard to change procedures once they’re finalized. Waddell: Is that why we just went through an   or   process to get here? Hennessey: Exactly. For questions both of genuine complexity and just government bureaucracy, the time horizon here is longer than a single term of the presidency. So I don’t think that it’s necessarily true that the intelligence community or the Department of Justice was rushing to get these procedures passed if anything, they’re a little bit late. But I think the bottom line is that it’s comforting to a large   community that these are procedures that are signed off by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and not by the DNI and attorney general that will ultimately be confirmed under the Trump Administration. Waddell: Is there anything else we should be thinking about with these new changes? Hennessey: People sometimes focus on the   stuff and end up missing the things that aren’t necessarily the symbolic expressions of privacy —  the things that make us feel good —  but are the functional elements of privacy and civil liberties. What rules do people apply    and how? There’s going to be a need moving forward to have disciplined conversations about the legal protections that really matter. If there is a silver lining to some of the anxieties that the incoming administration has produced, I think it’s the potential to move the conversation into a much more productive place. But that opportunity will end up being lost if the responses are the same old same. That’s my last shred of optimism, and I’m hanging on to it."
53350,73533,Why Mars Is the Best Planet,Atlantic,Rebecca Boyle,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"Our tale of two planets begins four billion years ago. One planet was Earth, and the other planet was Mars, and the two had much in common in their infancy. Rivers and lakes etched their surfaces, craters pockmarked their faces, and volcanoes rose from their plains. But something seems to have changed on one and not the other. In Earth’s burbling warm water, fate and chemistry combined amino acids into complex molecules, and in a process we still don’t understand, these gave rise to single cells that figured out how to make copies of themselves. Tiny mistakes in those copies eventually turned them into   organisms we call algae. Endless forms flowed from these humble ancestors, and after eons, there we were: All of human culture and hope and possibility arising within a tiny slice of time. Mars was not so lucky. Mars dried up. Mars is small, about half Earth’s diameter, so it cooled off faster than Earth did after their birth in the cloud of dust left over from the sun’s creation. Compared to its overall volume, more of Mars’ mass is exposed to the icy blackness of space. As it cooled, its   core solidified. When this happened, we think, the Martian magnetic field shut down, robbing Mars of its protective shield, of the sort that still safeguards Earth from solar and cosmic rays. Time and the brightening sun stripped away the Martian atmosphere before the planet’s algae, if it existed, had a chance to make the air thick and warm. Mars turned to rust before any skeletons could adorn its deserts, before any creatures could look up and contemplate their place among the other dots in the night sky. While Earth is fecund and bursting with life, Mars is, and may have always been, barren. To me, this is why Mars is the best planet. A few simple changes turn its history into our history, and vice versa. That’s the key thing that could have been us. Ashwin Vasavada has a similar view. He is the project scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory, the   robot car we know and love as Curiosity. He can quote the easy answer for why we go to Mars, the assumption most scientists and science writers make: Mars is close. It’s practically right next door, and you can fling a robot there in half a year. “That’s the NASA answer. It’s the most accessible place for life other than on Earth. But I have my own answer,” he says. “It’s a place that you can go today that’s like going to early Earth. You remove that dusty exterior of Mars, and you have this planet that is just so reminiscent of Earth. It’s like finding a dusty Earth in your attic. Shake off the dust a little bit, and it’s this amazing place that you can recognize. That’s why I like it. ” Mars would seem familiar to anyone who has seen the national parks of the American West, especially the ones full of   rock formations and surprising color. The terrain at Gale Crater’s Mount Sharp, where Curiosity has been trundling along since 2012, might as well be Utah or Colorado. The rocks are reddish brown,   and partly blanketed in sand dunes. Their   hillsides are jagged, however  —   no rivers or softening rains have given them Earth’s gentle countenance. Of course, Mars was familiar to us long before we sent robots there. With Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn, Mars is one of the night sky’s unblinking wanderers, visible with eyes alone. The planets have accompanied human culture since we started writing stories. The next planet over has been a fixture in myths dating to the Babylonians, who called it Nergal, after the god of destruction. In Roman mythology, Mars was the god of war and destabilization. This figure also appears in various forms in Greek, Norse, and Hindu mythologies. To ancient Chinese, it was   the Shimmering Planet. Even now, we acknowledge Mars on the third day of every week. In romance languages, the name comes from the Latin day of Mars, or “Dies Martis”  —   that became martes in Spanish, mardi in French. In Norse mythology, Mars is associated with the god Tyr, so our Tuesday comes from the Old English word Tiwesdæg. We also honor Mars on the third month of every year. Bellicose Mars was also a protector of the Roman people and a patron of agriculture, so the month named for this god marked the beginning of the growing season. Mars has always stood out from the other wanderers, in part because it is so obviously red, a ruddy, unblinking dot hanging with an air of menace. Its hue  —   which comes from oxidized iron, in the same chemical reaction that turns blood red  —   linked Mars to war, and to death, long before we knew it was dead in a literal sense. What’s more, it moves backward, or seems to. The sun, moon and stars rise in the east and fall in the west because of Earth’s rotation. But the planets orbit the sun at different rates, and so sometimes, Earth will lap one of them, like a runner on an inside track lane. From our perspective on Earth, the other planet seems to be moving west to east. This aberrant behavior has long been associated with omens or astrological predictions. Its omnipresence in our sky made Mars a prime target as soon as we figured out how to use glass to make the night sky’s features appear larger. By the 17th century, astronomers resolved its polar ice caps through telescopes  —   perhaps one of the earliest discoveries that the fourth planet shared something in common with ours. And the more we looked, the more we found these similarities. Mars is the best planet because Mars and Earth have more in common than any other worlds in the solar system. It cowers next to humongous Jupiter, but unlike that gas giant, its hard surface beckons visitors. Mars lacks our dewy,   atmosphere, but neither is it shrouded in a poisonous,   dense one like Venus. Its day (called a sol) is just 40 minutes longer than our own. Its axis is tilted slightly more than ours, at 25 degrees, unlike weirdly slanted Uranus. And anyone who argues it is ugly, especially compared to the art deco elegance of Saturn, is simply mistaken. Mars is lovely to behold. Mars has snow. It has mountains, and lake beds, and recognizable landscapes. Earth and Mars are the same in so many ways. And yet. The biggest difference is the only one that really matters. The only life on Mars is the kind we imagine. Martian fantasies grew in complexity alongside Martian observations. Astronomers frequently turned to the red planet when Mars was opposed to the sun and close to Earth, making it appear larger and brighter. The most famous of these was the opposition of 1877, in which the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli observed networks of lines on Mars, which later turned out to be optical illusions (though Mars does have streaks of water lining its slopes today). He called them canali, which was translated into English as “canals. ” This momentous finding brought Mars closer to Earth than ever. It became even easier to imagine Mars as a place just like Earth, positively crawling with life. “The present inhabitation of Mars by a race superior to ours is very probable,” the French astronomer Camille Flammarion wrote in 1892. Around the same time, the American astronomer Percival Lowell scrutinized Mars extensively. He believed he saw “  features,” including canals, which he imagined were devised to transport water from the drying planet’s ice caps. Mars soon loomed even larger in science fiction and pop culture. By 1897, H. G. Wells’ “War of the Worlds” imagined Mars as a slowly drying planet full of desperate beings who launch rockets to Earth, where they feast on human blood. If Mars was arguably the first place storytellers imagined we would find aliens, it was indeed the first place we went looking for them. Project Ozma, in which astronomer Frank Drake pointed a radio telescope at the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, is the traditional SETI origin story. But we listened to Mars first. In Aug. 22, 1924, the head of the U. S. Navy, Edward Eberle, instructed all naval stations to turn their receivers toward Mars. The red planet was at its closest approach to Earth in 120 years, and some astronomers thought Martians might use the opportunity to make contact over the airwaves. Onshore stations were advised to listen to as many frequencies as possible, and to “report any electrical phenomenon [of] unusual character,” according to a telegram from Eberle. If someone wanted to talk, the Navy was ready to listen. No Martians made contact that day, because there are no Martians, as far as any of our satellites and robots can tell. But this has not stopped our storytellers, and it certainly has not stopped our scientists. We have been attempting to land spacecraft on Mars for nearly 50 years, and almost all of them have been looking for life, in one way or another. The history of Mars landings has shown that the planet is anything but hospitable now, however. And that goes for machines just as much as microbes. More than half of the robots sent to Mars have been destroyed in the process, most recently last fall. The European Space Agency’s Schiaparelli lander plummeted through the atmosphere Oct. 19, but crashed after it cut its parachute too soon and its   retrorockets didn’t fire long enough. Still, those lucky few that have made it, most notably Curiosity, have shown us Mars was habitable in its past. The fleet of orbiters looping around the planet have sent back data that suggests there is some water there today, mostly at the poles. But we are still not sure if Mars had lasting oceans, or just big lakes and rivers, says Ray Arvidson, a renowned planetary scientist who has directed or taken part in every NASA Mars mission since Viking. And we certainly don’t know whether it had life. “It’s not a given. It’s not a   by any means, that Mars developed life, and if it did, that the evidence is still there,” Arvidson says. “Whether or not you get organic molecules that move to prebiotic compounds, that then move to replicating systems, that’s a big leap. ” Even assuming that leap happened, Vasavada and others say we are more likely to find evidence of ancient life than modern life. Extant or extinct Martians would probably be bacteria or some other simple cells, definitely not limbed beings that communicate using light or language. In this way, Mars may seem disappointing to some. But it is the best planet precisely because a null result, as scientists would call it, would raise an even bigger question: Why here? Why us? “I think it just becomes a real scientific mystery if we don’t find life. That tells us we don’t quite understand how unique life is on Earth,” Vasavada says. “If you don’t find it, that almost becomes more interesting, and makes you get more existential about life on Earth. That’s where I am now. ” For those who take an even longer existential view, Mars is important  —   vital, even. When Elon Musk unveiled his plans for giant rockets and spaceships to transport human settlers to Mars, he invoked not only exploration, but our shared future. Mars is an opportunity for humans to carry forward the light of consciousness, letting it propagate alongside us, and to survive after we are gone, much like the first cells on Earth found a way to send copies of themselves into the future. If Musk and other dreamers have their way, the first life forms on Mars might be us. But make no mistake: It will be a horrible, destructive journey. Unlike the territories of colonial history  —   the West Indies, the American West and other frontiers  —   Mars does not tickle the mind with dreams of untold riches. Mars is no El Dorado. Its atmosphere does not hold any heat. It has no pressure to prevent your blood from vaporizing. Without a spacesuit, you would literally boil and freeze to death, simultaneously. Mars travelers would be consigned forever to pressurized domes or, more likely,   caves. They would never again see waves lapping at a shoreline. They would never again hear the wind singing through pine trees. They would never again be surprised by the sight of a silvery crescent moon. Why go, then? I was at JPL when Curiosity landed in August 2012, and I couldn’t help clapping along with the NASA engineers and scientists who whooped and hollered at the news. The dust had barely settled after Curiosity’s audacious sky crane landing when the rover sent back its first postcard, the grainy image you see here. “It’s the wheel! It’s the wheel!” someone in the control room shouted. Squinting at the    image of a wheel on a rocky plain, I felt a rush of emotion. The rover’s belly cast a shadow in the afternoon sun. The scene looked so familiar, but felt so wrong. It could have been the mountain West where I grew up, only it was empty, lifeless but for the robot now perched on the sand. If Saturn is a spur to the scientific imagination, letting us glimpse how far our minds must go to meet what the cosmos has in store, Mars does the opposite. It is a sign of how unlikely we are. It makes us confront how fragile the Earth is. It’s a reminder of how lonely we remain on our pale blue dot, the only home we have ever known. Mars is the best planet because Mars is a mirror. We look to it and we see ourselves  —   our past and possibility, and, with some imagination, our future."
53351,73534,"In Switzerland, You Can Be Denied Citizenship for Being Too Annoying",Atlantic,Megan Garber,2017-01-14,2017.0,1.0,,"Nancy Holten, 42, was born in the Netherlands. At the age of 8, however, she moved with her family to Switzerland, which Holten has called home for the past 34 years. Holten currently resides, with her three daughters, in the small village of   in the far north of the country, within the canton of Aargau. She speaks fluent  . Her daughters are Swiss citizens. She has been a member of the parents’ committee of their school. And yet Holten was recently rejected for a Swiss passport —  which is also to say, effectively, for naturalized Swiss citizenship. For the second time. The reason? In Switzerland, applications for naturalization are decided not at the federal level, but rather by the country’s cantons and municipalities —  and the applicants’ peers have a say in whether naturalization gets granted. And, unfortunately for Nancy Holten, her peers are not inclined to give her the “gift” of a passport. Because, despite all the ways she is Swiss, Holten —  a vegan who is extremely vocal about that life choice —  has also stridently opposed one of the most beloved cultural traditions of   and of Aargau, and of Switzerland itself: the practice of putting large bells around the necks of cows, for reasons both practical and ceremonial. Insert your preferred “more cowbell” joke here. In 2015, Holten’s application for naturalization was approved by local authorities but then rejected, in a vote, by 144 of 206 residents of  . In November of 2016, a similarly sized group gathered at a communal assembly to hear Holten’s case. Some of the attendees booed her as the debates took place. For them, it seems, the matter wasn’t so much that Holten was outspoken in her criticism of the bells (though Tanja Suter, the president of the local branch of the Swiss People’s Party, did complain to reporters that Holten has a “big mouth”). The problem was rather that Holten’s activism, they have said, displays a lack of respect for the village’s —  and the country’s —  cultural traditions. The problem was also, more to the point, that Holten had demonstrated that disrespect so publicly. “The reason why they have yet again clearly rejected the naturalization is that Nancy Holten very often expresses her personal opinion in the media,” Urs Treier, a spokesman for the   administration, told The Local. He added that Holten also “gathers media coverage for rebelling against traditional [Swiss] things within the village. ” It’s an explanation that offers a lot to ruminate on. The village’s reaction to Holten’s   activism is reminiscent on the one hand of those “common scold” laws they used to have in Europe and, for a time, the United States. Sanded of its edges, after all, here is that most   of things: a woman speaking her mind, and being roundly condemned for it. And here is a woman speaking, too, for creatures that cannot speak for themselves. “The animals carry around five kilograms around their neck,” Holten explained of her    advocacy. “It causes friction and burns to their skin. ” (Plus, she added: “The sound that cow bells make is  . . .. We also would not want such a thing hanging close to our ears. ”) How Swimming Classes Became an Integration Issue in Switzerland, Holten also rejects the idea that her advocacy of animal rights doubles as an attack on Swiss culture. “Many people think that I am attacking their traditions,” she told The Local. “But that was not what it was about, it was never about that. What primarily motivated me about the cowbells was the animals’ welfare. ” Not helping Nancy Holten to defend herself against her peers’ charges of her general gadflyery, however, is the fact that she followed up her    effort with another campaign —  this time, against the ringing of church bells early in the morning, another locally beloved element of the culture of  . Holten’s efforts in this case won her the name, among her fellow villagers, “Glockengegnerin” —  roughly, “the  . ” They did not win her, however, any additional friends in the area. Nor did the other campaigns Holten has waged against local pastimes, among them hunting and pig racing —  the latter of which the Swiss National Tourist Office highlights as one of the nation’s “living traditions. ”   Whether Holten is a hero or a menace or something in between, Swiss law itself is not necessarily on her side in all this. According to Switzerland’s Federal Act on the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Citizenship, established in 1952, Swiss citizenship “may be obtained by a permanent resident who lived in Switzerland for at least 12 years   …     and lived in the country for 3 out of the last 5 years before applying for citizenship. ” The resident must speak, depending on the canton, at least one of Switzerland’s primary languages: German (preferably Swiss German) French, Italian, or Romansch. But the resident must also demonstrate: It’s those last two that have helped Holten’s fellow villagers to transform casual ostracism into something decidedly more official. As Tanja Suter of the Swiss People’s Party made clear: Holten’s peers would not grant her citizenship “if she annoys us and doesn’t respect our traditions. ” That kind of thing, Urs Treier reiterated, “can cause the community to not want such a person in their midst. ” But that community, it turns out, will not have the final word in deciding Holten’s fate. Her case has moved on, as some of Switzerland’s more complicated naturalization applications will do, to the cantonal government, which is empowered to override the rejections administered by the locals of  . Holten may still be granted naturalization she may be rejected once again. If things don’t go her way for the third time, however, perhaps she should consider seeking residency instead in a country that rewards brashness, and idiosyncrasy, and above all media savvy —  a country that makes a political virtue out of rankling one’s peers. Holten, after all, who is Dutch by birth, Swiss by choice, but, it seems, very much American by temperament, is already at work on a book about herself and her bovine ordeal. It is tentatively titled Celle qui énerve, or, What Annoys."
53352,73535,SpaceX Sticks the Landing in Triumphant Return,Atlantic,Marina Koren,2017-01-14,2017.0,1.0,,"SpaceX successfully launched a rocket into orbit Saturday for the first time since a launchpad explosion last fall destroyed another rocket and its $200 million payload, just days before their scheduled flight. The Falcon 9 rocket launched from an air force base in California’s central coast, carrying 10 satellites for   communications company Iridium. Its first stage then returned to Earth and landed on a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean, a maneuver the spaceflight company has completed several times already. The successful launch restores some momentum for Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The company went into hibernation after its rocket and the Israeli communications satellite on board went up in flames during a fueling process. SpaceX, along with several federal aviation and transportation agencies, spent four months investigating the incident. It announced the results earlier this month, saying the explosion was caused by a failure of the rocket’s helium tanks. SpaceX needed this successful launch to reassure NASA, which is expecting the company to begin flying astronauts to the International Space Station next year. Last week, a safety advisory group within the space agency called for scrutiny of SpaceX’s rocket fueling process. SpaceX previously lost a Falcon 9 rocket in June 2015, breaking a streak of successful launches for the company. The rocket exploded two minutes after takeoff, destroying the supplies it was supposed to carry to the International Space Station. “I think to some degree, the company as a whole became maybe a little bit complacent after twenty successes in a row,” Musk said back then. A Wall Street Journal report published last week shows just how much that incident set SpaceX back. The explosion, together with the resulting delays in future launches, led to a $260 million loss that year and a 6 percent drop in revenue, according to internal financial documents seen by the Journal. Saturday’s launch is the first of seven SpaceX is scheduled to conduct for Iridium. It kicks off a potentially big year for the SpaceX. In addition to a dozen planned launches in 2017, Musk wants to test the Falcon Heavy, a rocket that can carry larger payloads to   destinations like Mars, and the Crew Dragon spaceship that will eventually carry NASA astronauts to the International Space Station."
53353,73536,"Trump, Remember You Are a Man",Atlantic,Dominic Tierney,2017-01-14,2017.0,1.0,,"In ancient Rome, the ultimate honor was to receive a triumph, or a lavish parade through Rome to celebrate a great military victory. The hero would ride a chariot, accompanied by the veterans of the campaign and the plunder of war —  the ranks of prisoners, vessels of gold, crowns of pearls, and placards bearing the names of conquered nations —  all the way to the Temple of Jupiter where he would make a sacrifice to the god. According to ancient sources, a slave stood in the great man’s chariot, held a golden crown over his head, and whispered in his ear, “remember you are a man. ” At the very moment of exultation, the honoree was given a word of warning: You are mortal and glory is transient. Donald Trump is about to enjoy his own triumph —  the inauguration as president. There may never have been a president more at risk of hubris. Where is the voice whispering in his ear, urging humility? Senate Confirmation Hearings: Day 3, Psychologists have found that most people are prone to overconfidence about their own abilities and control over events. In a 2004 survey of almost 1 million high school students, just 2 percent rated their leadership skills as “below average. ” Motorcyclists, businessmen, college professors, Bungee jumpers —  all tend to think they’re better than the norm. Overconfidence can also vary significantly. Men tend to be more overconfident than women (although some studies suggest this isn’t always the case). Americans are more overconfident than East Asians. As two psychologists put it, “Americans are widely regarded as the most optimistic people on earth. ” Elites are more prone to overconfidence, whether they’re   chess players or masters of the universe on Wall Street. Given all this, Donald Trump seems almost uniquely likely to succumb to hubris. Not only is he male, American, and a member of the elite (for all his talk of populism) but he also instinctively responds to challenges by coming out swinging, and is prone to narcissistic or arrogant behavior, such as declaring he doesn’t need daily intelligence briefings, where he says he would hear “the same thing in the same words every single day. ” At different times, Trump has retweeted a quote from Benito Mussolini (“It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep”) and lauded Saddam Hussein (“you know what he did well? He killed terrorists”) —  two autocrats known for their   overconfidence. The initial months of a Trump presidency present particular risks of hubris. Early on, presidents may be tempted by wild adventures, before the realities of office temper their hopes and dreams. Soon after taking the oath of office, JFK gave the green light to the outlandishly flawed Bay of Pigs invasion. George W. Bush espoused missionary crusading zeal after   but cut a more chastened figure in his second term. Overconfidence can be a useful trait in some ways, by encouraging leaders to persevere in the face of obstacles. But illusions of triumph can also lead to catastrophic decisions like the invasion of Iraq, where officials predicted that U. S. troops would be greeted as liberators, and neglected the chances of disorder or insurgency following regime change. A RAND study found that in   analyses: “post conflict stabilization and reconstruction were addressed only very generally, largely because of the prevailing view that the task would not be difficult. ” What if Trump encounters an unexpected   crisis in the early months of his administration? What if North Korea launches a fresh provocation? What if Trump deploys larger numbers of military forces to the Middle East to combat jihadi terrorists? It is difficult or impossible to   against overconfidence. Ironically, a classic example of positive illusions is that people believe they are better than their peers at seeing things accurately, uncontaminated by overconfidence. The most effective way to check hubris is to empower outsiders, such as a board of directors who can hold a CEO accountable. Trump doesn’t have a board, but he does have a Cabinet. Trump once said that he might not come to the aid of NATO allies. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed unworried because Trump’s advisers would take a different perspective. “I don’t think that view would be prevalent or held by anybody he might make secretary of state or secretary of defense. ” But will Trump listen to his team? Research shows that inexperienced presidents often rely on a narrower range of advisers, and may not defer to those more experienced for fear of looking weak. And it’s not clear that the incoming national security adviser, the retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, or secretary of state designate Rex Tillerson will be an effective check on the president. This week, for example, in his Senate confirmation hearings, Tillerson struggled to answer predictable questions about his perceived softness toward Russia and President Vladimir Putin. And no one expects Trump’s       and senior policy adviser, Jared Kushner, to lecture the president if he oversteps. Much rests, therefore, on the shoulders of Trump’s nominee for secretary of defense, James Mattis. He is no yes man. Mattis is a   retired Marine Corps general who headed U. S. Central Command. There are two sides to Mattis, captured by his nicknames. One is “Mad Dog,” the   fighter who speaks his mind and knows that war means killing: “There are some assholes in the world that just need to be shot. ” And then there’s Mattis the “Warrior Monk,” the   with a library of thousands of books of military history, who helped oversee the writing of the Army and Marine Corps’ field manual on   which stressed winning “hearts and minds” and using limited firepower. Mattis should sail through the confirmation process. In his Senate hearings, Mattis leashed the mad dog, and offered a calm warrior monk appraisal of the world: Putin is a threat, global order is at risk, and alliances are critical to American security. There was hyperbole in Mattis’s claim that the world order is “under the biggest attack since World War II,” which ignored the Cold War, and the Soviet and Chinese efforts to bury the West. But the senators seemed to find the centrist internationalism on show to be deeply reassuring. Americans need someone who will educate, encourage, and if necessary, restrain, an inexperienced president. Mattis has been known to carry a book of quotes from Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor. With an eye on Roman history, perhaps he can be the chariot whisperer."
53354,73537,The Curse of Econ 101,Atlantic,James Kwak,2017-01-14,2017.0,1.0,,"In a rich,   society, where most people walk around with supercomputers in their pockets and a person can have virtually anything delivered to his or her doorstep overnight, it seems wrong that people who work should have to live in poverty. Yet in America, there are more than ten million members of the working poor: people in the workforce whose household income is below the poverty line. Looking around, it isn’t hard to understand why. The two most common occupations in the United States are retail salesperson and cashier. Eight million people have one of those two jobs, which typically pay about $9 —  $10 per hour. It’s hard to make ends meet on such meager wages. A few years ago, McDonald’s was embarrassed by the revelation that its internal help line was recommending that even a   restaurant employee apply for various forms of public assistance. Poverty in the midst of plenty exists because many working people simply don’t make very much money. This is possible because the minimum wage that businesses must pay is low: only $7. 25 per hour in the United States in 2016 (although it is higher in some states and cities). At that rate, a person working   for a whole year, with no vacations or holidays, earns about $15, 000 —  which is below the poverty line for a family of two, let alone a family of four. A   employee is poor enough to qualify for food stamps and, in most states, Medicaid. Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum is roughly the same as in the 1960s and 1970s, despite significant increases in average living standards over that period. The United States currently has the lowest minimum wage, as a proportion of its average wage, of any advanced economy, contributing to today’s soaring levels of inequality. At first glance, it seems that raising the minimum wage would be a good way to combat poverty. The argument against increasing the minimum wage often relies on what I call “economism” —  the misleading application of basic lessons from Economics 101 to   problems, creating the illusion of consensus and reducing a complex topic to a simple,    case. According to economism, a pair of supply and demand curves proves that a minimum wage increases unemployment and hurts exactly the   workers it is supposed to help. The argument goes like this:   labor is bought and sold in a market, just like any good or service, and its price should be set by supply and demand. A minimum wage, however, upsets this happy equilibrium because it sets a price floor in the market for labor. If it is below the natural wage rate, then nothing changes. But if the minimum (say, $7. 25 an hour) is above the natural wage (say, $6 per hour) it distorts the market. More people want jobs at $7. 25 than at $6, but companies want to hire fewer employees. The result: more unemployment. The people who are still employed are better off, because they are being paid more for the same work their gain is exactly balanced by their employers’ loss. But society as a whole is worse off, as transactions that would have benefited both buyers and suppliers of labor will not occur because of the minimum wage. These are jobs that someone would have been willing to do for less than $6 per hour and for which some company would have been willing to pay more than $6 per hour. Now those jobs are gone, as well as the goods and services that they would have produced. The minimum wage has been a hobgoblin of economism since its origins. Henry Hazlitt wrote in Economics in One Lesson, “For a low wage you substitute unemployment. You do harm all around, with no comparable compensation. ” In Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman patronizingly described the minimum wage as “about as clear a case as one can find of a measure the effects of which are precisely the opposite of those intended by the men of good will who support it. ” Because employers will not pay people more money than their work is worth, he continued, “insofar as   laws have any effect at all, their effect is clearly to increase poverty. ” Jude Wanniski similarly concluded in The Way the World Works, “Every increase in the minimum wage induces a decline in real output and a decline in employment. ” On the campaign trail in 1980, Ronald Reagan said, “The minimum wage has caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the Great Depression. ” Think tanks including Cato, Heritage, and the Manhattan Institute have reliably attacked the minimum wage for decades, all the while emphasizing the key lesson from Economics 101: Higher wages cause employers to cut jobs. In today’s environment of increasing economic inequality, the minimum wage is a centerpiece of political debate. California, New York City, and Seattle are all raising their minimums to $15, and President Barack Obama called for a federal minimum of $10. 10. An army of commentators has responded by reminding us of what we should have learned in Economics 101. In The Wall Street Journal, the economist Richard Vedder explained, “If the price of something rises, people buy less of it —  including labor. Thus governmental interferences such as   laws lower the quantity of labor demanded. ” Writing for Forbes, Tim Worstall offered a mathematical proof: “A reduction in wage costs of some few thousand dollars increases employment. Obviously therefore a rise in wage costs of four or five times that is going to have significant unemployment effects. QED: A $15 minimum wage is going to destroy many jobs. ” (Of theoretical arguments in favor of a higher minimum wage, he continued, “I’m afraid I really just don’t believe those arguments. ”) Jonah Goldberg of the American Enterprise Institute and National Review chimed in, “A minimum wage is no different from a tax on firms that use   and unskilled labor. And if there’s anything that economists agree upon, it’s that if you tax something you get less of it. ” The real impact of the minimum wage, however, is much less clear than these talking points might indicate. Looking at historical experience, there is no obvious relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment: adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum was highest from 1967 through 1969, when the unemployment rate was below 4 percent —  a historically low level. When economists try to tackle this question, they come up with all sorts of results. In 1994, David Card and Alan Krueger evaluated an increase in New Jersey’s minimum wage by comparing   restaurants on both sides of the New   border. They concluded, “Contrary to the central prediction of the textbook model . .. we find no evidence that the rise in New Jersey’s minimum wage reduced employment at   restaurants in the state. ” Card and Krueger’s findings have been vigorously contested across dozens of empirical studies. Today, people on both sides of the debate can cite papers supporting their position, and reviews of the academic research disagree on what conclusions to draw. David Neumark and William Wascher, economists who have long argued against the minimum wage, reviewed more than one hundred empirical papers in 2006. Although the studies had a wide range of results, they concluded that the “preponderance of the evidence” indicated that a higher minimum wage does increase unemployment. On the other hand, two recent   (which pool together the results of multiple analyses) have found that increasing the minimum wage does not have a significant impact on employment. In the past several years, a new round of sophisticated analyses comparing changes in employment levels between neighboring counties also found “strong earnings effects and no employment effects of minimum wage increases. ” (That is, the number of jobs stays the same and workers make more money.) Not surprisingly, Neumark and Wascher have contested this approach. The profession as a whole is divided on the topic: When the University of Chicago Booth School of Business asked a panel of prominent economists in 2013 whether increasing the minimum wage to $9 would “make it noticeably harder for   workers to find employment,” the responses were split down the middle. The idea that a higher minimum wage might not increase unemployment runs directly counter to the lessons of Economics 101. According to the textbook, if labor becomes more expensive, companies buy less of it. But there are several reasons why the real world does not behave so predictably. Although the standard model predicts that employers will replace workers with machines if wages increase, additional   technologies are not available to every company at a reasonable cost. Small employers in particular have limited flexibility at their scale, they may not be able to maintain their operations with fewer workers. (Imagine a local copy shop: No matter how fast the copy machine is, there still needs to be one person to deal with customers.) Therefore, some companies can’t lay off employees if the minimum wage is increased. At the other extreme, very large employers may have enough market power that the usual    model doesn’t apply to them. They can reduce the wage level by hiring fewer workers (only those willing to work for low pay) just as a monopolist can boost prices by cutting production (think of an oil cartel, for example). A minimum wage forces them to pay more, which eliminates the incentive to minimize their workforce. In the above examples, a higher minimum wage will raise labor costs. But many companies can recoup cost increases in the form of higher prices because most of their customers are not poor, the net effect is to transfer money from   to   families. In addition, companies that pay more often benefit from higher employee productivity, offsetting the growth in labor costs. Justin Wolfers and Jan Zilinsky identified several reasons why higher wages boost productivity: They motivate people to work harder, they attract   workers, and they reduce employee turnover, lowering hiring and training costs, among other things. If fewer people quit their jobs, that also reduces the number of people who are out of work at any one time because they’re looking for something better. A higher minimum wage motivates more people to enter the labor force, raising both employment and output. Finally, higher pay increases workers’ buying power. Because poor people spend a relatively large proportion of their income, a higher minimum wage can boost overall economic activity and stimulate economic growth, creating more jobs. All of these factors vastly complicate the   diagram taught in Economics 101 and help explain why a higher minimum wage does not necessarily throw people out of work. The    diagram is a good conceptual starting point for thinking about the minimum wage. But on its own, it has limited predictive value in the much more complex real world. Even if a higher minimum wage does cause some people to lose their jobs, that cost has to be balanced against the benefit of greater earnings for other   workers. A study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that a $10. 10 minimum would reduce employment by 500, 000 jobs but would increase incomes for most poor families, moving 900, 000 people above the poverty line. Similarly, a recent paper by the economist Arindrajit Dube finds that a 10 percent raise in the minimum wage should reduce the number of families living in poverty by around 2 percent to 3 percent. The economists polled in the 2013 Chicago Booth study thought that increasing the minimum wage would be a good idea because its potential impact on employment would be outweighed by the benefits to people who were still able to find jobs. Raising the minimum wage would also reduce inequality by narrowing the pay gap between   and   workers. In short, whether the minimum wage should be increased (or eliminated) is a complicated question. The economic research is difficult to parse, and arguments often turn on sophisticated econometric details. Any change in the minimum wage would have different effects on different groups of people, and should also be compared with other policies that could help the working poor —  such as the negative income tax (a cash grant to   households, similar to today’s Earned Income Tax Credit) favored by Milton Friedman, or the guaranteed minimum income that Friedrich Hayek assumed would exist. Instead of greedily demanding higher profits, industry executives can invoke Economics 101, which provides a simple explanation of the world that serves their interests. Nevertheless, when the topic reaches the national stage, it is economism’s facile punch line that gets delivered, along with its   dismissal: people who want a higher minimum wage just don’t understand economics (although, by that standard, several Nobel Prize winners don’t understand economics). Many leading political figures largely repeat the central theses of economism, claiming that they have only the best interests of the poor at heart. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Senator Marco Rubio opposed increasing the minimum wage because companies would then substitute capital for labor: “I’m worried about the people whose wage is going to go down to zero because you’ve made them more expensive than a machine. ” Senator Ted Cruz also chimed in on behalf of the poor, saying, “the minimum wage consistently hurts the most vulnerable. ” Senator Rand Paul explained, “when the [minimum wage] is above the market wage it causes unemployment” because it reduces the number of employees whom companies can afford to hire. The former governor Jeb Bush also invoked Economics 101, saying that wages should be left “to the private sector,” meaning companies like Walmart, which “raised wages because of supply and demand. ” For Congressman Paul Ryan, raising the minimum wage is “bad economics” and “will hurt the economy because it raises the price of labor. ” This conviction that the minimum wage hurts the poor is an example of economism in action. Economists have many different opinions on the subject, based on different theories and research studies, but when it comes to public debate, one particular result of one particular model is presented as an unassailable economic theorem. (Politicians advocating for a higher minimum wage, by contrast, tend to avoid economic models altogether, instead arguing in terms of fairness or helping the poor.) This happens partly because the competitive market model taught in introductory economics classes is simple, clear, and memorable. But it also happens because there is a large interest group that wants to keep the minimum wage low: businesses that rely heavily on cheap labor. The restaurant industry has been a major force behind the advertising and public relations campaigns opposing the minimum wage, including many of the   articles repeating the basic lesson of supply and demand. For example, Andy Puzder, the CEO of a restaurant company (and   Trump’s nominee to lead the Labor Department) explained in The Wall Street Journal, “Every retailer has locations that are profitable, but only marginally. Increased labor costs can push these stores over the line and into the loss column. When that happens, companies that want to stay competitive will close them. ” As a result, “broad increases in the minimum wage destroy jobs and hurt the   Americans that they are supposed to help. ” A recent study by researchers at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration, however, found that higher minimum wages have not affected either the number of restaurants or the number of people that they employ, contrary to the industry’s dire predictions, while they have modestly increased workers’ pay. Because restaurant closings do not seem to increase, the implication is that paying employees more cuts into excess profits —  profits beyond those necessary to stay in business. Or, as the financial commentator Barry Ritholtz put it, “raising the minimum wage works as a wealth transfer, from shareholders and franchisees, to minimum wage workers. ” But instead of greedily demanding higher profits, industry executives can invoke Economics 101, which provides a simple explanation of the world that serves their interests. The fact that this is the debate already demonstrates the historical influence of economism. Once upon a time, the major issue affecting workers’ wages and income inequality was unionization. In the 1950s, about one in every three wage and salary employees was a union member. Unions, of course, were an early and frequent target of economism. Hayek argued that unions are bad both for workers, because “they cannot in the long run increase real wages for all wishing to work above the level that would establish itself in a free market,” and for society as a whole, because “by establishing effective monopolies in the supply of the different kinds of labor, the unions will prevent competition from acting as an effective regulator of the allocation of all resources. ” For Friedman, unions “harmed the public at large and workers as a whole by distorting the use of labor” while increasing inequality even within the working class. The changing composition of the U. S. workforce, state    laws, and aggressive   tactics by employers —  increasingly tolerated by the National Labor Relations Board, beginning with the Reagan administration —  all contributed to a long, slow fall in unionization levels. By 2015, only 12 percent of wage and salary employees were union members —  fewer than 7 percent in the private sector.   and   workers’ reduced bargaining power is a major reason why their wages have not kept pace with the overall growth of the economy. According to an analysis by the sociologists Bruce Western and Jake Rosenfeld,   to   of the increase in inequality between 1973 and 2007 results from the decline of unions. With unions only a distant memory for many people, federal   legislation has become the best hope for propping up wages for   workers. And again, the worldview of economism comes to the aid of employers by abstracting away from the reality of   work to a pristine world ruled by the “law” of supply and demand.

53355,73538,"Goodbye, American Apparel",Atlantic,Bourree Lam,2017-01-14,2017.0,1.0,,"It’s finally over for American Apparel, the trendy   plagued clothing brand whose first store opened in 1997. On Thursday, a bankruptcy court in Delaware approved an $88 million sale of the brand’s intellectual property and manufacturing equipment to Gildan, a Canadian apparel company that focuses on wholesale. Gildan will pay an additional $15 million to acquire American Apparel’s purchase orders and inventory, effectively giving the buyer all the tools it needs to launch a new clothing line from the ruins of the now defunct brand. Millennials —  especially those who identify with the term hipsters —  likely remember a time in the early naughts when American Apparel’s snug, expensive   were emblematic of    cool. The company’s marketing blended the   altruistic mission of making things in America while its advertising featured    sex appeal of one of America’s favorite traits: youth. That all unraveled as reports surfaced about the company’s labor practices, which included employing immigrants with questionable documents and worker complaints to the National Labor Relations Board which were eventually dismissed. Then there was the company’s signature sexy marketing, which became a point of tension when a string of sexual harassment lawsuits were filed against its founder Dov Charney, many of which have been settled (including more than $3 million in court settlements in 2015, according to the Wall Street Journal). As of January 2017, at least one lawsuit was still pending according Los Angeles Superior Court records. “The company was highly successful. Prior to my ousting, it generated $5 billion in the last 10 years,” said Charney in an interview on Friday. In recent months, Charney said he didn’t think the company would survive without his leadership, and denies the claims that his misconduct contributed to the company’s downfall. “This is a manifestation of Wall Street malfeasance,” he continued, referring to his ousting. “The company got driven into the ground. ” Charney —   who is Canadian, ironically —  has a classic entrepreneurship story: He started American Apparel as a “Made in America”   company out of his dorm room at Tufts University in 1989.   years later, the company recorded $633 million in sales with over 200 stores in over 20 countries. But in the past three years, the company has faced huge debts, costly legal battles involving its founder, and a drop in sales. American Apparel did what any company does in these moments: turn to private investors for help. Eventually, Charney was ousted by his own board. At the company’s bankruptcy hearing last November, its second bankruptcy filing in two years, the company reported $177 million in debt. “The story of American Apparel is the best and worst of all things,” said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. “As brilliant a merchant and marketer as [Charney] was, he was guilty of never having taken seriously enough the need to organize his company efficiently, especially to offset the fact that he was working with domestic manufacturing. ” There was a cultural shift that hampered American Apparel, too. Elizabeth Segran at Racked summed it up best, “In their heyday, [American Apparel and Urban Outfitters] made a science of identifying exactly what it was that made hipsters so attractive, then recreated that aesthetic in their stores. ” But the company’s plan of   a particular vein of counterculture lost its allure, as consumer tastes shifted. Zara, one of the most successful   stories in the past several years, focuses on selling     looking clothes that are inexpensive —  a distinct contrast to American Apparel’s stark and basic approach to apparel. But fashion wasn’t the only thing to change the retail business changed, too. The economic downturn was hard on the fashion industry as consumers cut back on spending. And    stores have struggled as online retailers bite into their sales and target demographics. That can be especially harmful for brands like American Apparel, whose the business model is to open a bevy of stores and rely on foot traffic. “There are too many stores in too many places,” explained Cohen. “Everybody doing business in    is migrating in some way, shape, or form to the internet. Everyone is seeing a  chronic decline in the productivity of their real estate. ” All of this helps explain why the $88 million Gildan deal could be viewed as arguably the last great American Apparel marketing feat. Even with all its financial and legal woes, the company still attracted 12 bids. (Sources told Reuters that Amazon and Forever 21 were considering purchasing as well.) And while Gildan won’t be purchasing any of American Apparel’s 110 U. S. stores —  which were also up for sale —  the company was willing to pay nearly $90 million just for intellectual property and some equipment.  That’s quite a feat given that the brand was built on the premise of selling such basic designs. “The company is dead,” said Charney. “They’re just tossing around a brand. It’s like Polaroid or Sharper Image. The spirit of American Apparel is dead. ” Cohen suspects that the deal is more about Gildan weighing the cost of creating a new brand from scratch, along with the value of the manufacturing equipment included in the deal. “Though the marketing was salacious, the product is conventional,” explains Cohen. It especially makes sense for Gildan, the company that’s benefited from the online   economy, where custom shirts is big business. Questions remain about whether Gildan will keep American Apparel’s    . S. promise. On Thursday night, the L. A. Times reported that one of the company’s factories in California has been sold to a local textile firm. And though American Apparel is shuttering, its creator is looking for a new start. Charney has a new apparel company, tentatively named That’s Los Angeles. Its marquee product? Plain ol’    ."

53357,73540,Tiny Amounts of LSD for Depression,Atlantic,Olga Khazan,2017-01-14,2017.0,1.0,,"Throughout Ayelet Waldman’s entire life, she’s been “held hostage by the vagaries of mood,” as she explains in her new book, A Really Good Day. She is a bestselling author, mom of four, and devoted wife, but her mental illness threatened it all. On good days, she was funny, productive, and kind. But on bad ones, she would catastrophize and snap at her family. So profound was her   at times that, planted on a couples’ therapist’s couch, she couldn’t bring herself to say that her husband, the novelist Michael Chabon, loves her. A clear diagnosis (was it bipolar II or extreme PMS?) effective treatment (Effexor or Adderall?) and even the fleeting tranquility of a “good day” were all elusive. So Waldman did what few   American moms —  though perhaps quite a few moms living in Berkeley, California —  would think to do: Drop acid. She procured a small,   bottle of diluted LSD from a friend of a friend. It was meant for “microdosing” —  taking a fraction of a typical dose every few days, not enough to hallucinate or get high. Instead, the mind opens up just a crack and allows the bleak thoughts to escape for a while. (“Not so much an acid trip as an acid errand,” she assures.) Waldman begins taking two drops every three days. As the title suggests, over the month her supply lasts, she enjoys several unfrazzled,   “really good” days. As a relatively   former attorney, Waldman offers a different perspective from the young tech entrepreneurs who have copped to microdosing to enhance their creativity and output. Her newbie status distinguishes her book, as does the unique way she weaves in digressions about drug policy and the   system. I spoke with Waldman recently about her experience an edited transcript of our conversation follows. Olga Khazan: What would you say was the biggest advantage for you of the microdosing, from your mood to your work? Ayelet Waldman: I think for me personally the most important thing was that it kind of   me out of a pretty significant depression. Let’s say an incident happens, someone says something that hurts your feelings, you see a tweet, whatever it is, some kind of stimulus, there’s sort of this   process. You see this, there’s the incident, you have an emotional reaction, a feeling, then you have a thought about that feeling, then you have a kind of impulse, and you act on the impulse, right? What has always happened to me is those four separate responses were all sort of clumped together. So I would see something on Twitter, and I would respond right away. There was no time at which I thought, oh you’re having a feeling about this, this is making me angry. Is it really making you angry or is it making you sad? Is it making you scared? And then, here’s the impulse to act. Is that the right [way] to really be acting? I would do these things that I would regret, which would, for me, end up catalyzing kind of a depression. For some reason the LSD microdose sort of slowed me down. I’m sort of trying to figure out 100 different ways to say this other than “mindfulness,” because I find the whole concept sort of aggravating. But I do think it came down to that. I felt happier or at least not as profoundly depressed almost immediately the very first day I took it. God, here I am twisting myself into a knot to not say “mindfulness,” but that really is what it is. Khazan: You tried a lot of different pills in the past, antidepressants and other drugs. Those are all newer things and they have lots of scientists working on them, testing them, and trying to market them. Why do you think this old psychedelic worked better than all those different drugs? Waldman: First of all, this is a   experiment, and there’s no guarantee that it would have continued to work, and there’s also no research that what I was experiencing wasn’t, as I say in the book, ”the mother of all placebo effects.” But let’s say that it was, let’s say that what I experienced taking the microdose was an actual, real effect and not all in my head. I took SSRIs, I took Wellbutrin, I took some of the ADHD drugs, but only very briefly. But they didn’t work to enhance neuroplasticity in the same way that LSD does. My theory is that it has something to do with the neuroplastic effects. And the range of side effects of all these newer meds is really robust. LSD just doesn’t have that many side effects. I mean except the most obvious one, which is if you take too much you start tripping your balls off. Khazan: One thing I loved about this is you explore other issues in drug policy throughout the book. I was wondering if you could give a   layman’  summary of why people can’t just microdose with LSD. Why is it illegal to acquire even in really small amounts? Waldman: Very simply, LSD is on Schedule I. Schedule I is a drug that’s considered to have no medical use and significant harm. Heroin is on Schedule I, LSD is on Schedule I, marijuana is on Schedule I. You say to yourself that doesn’t make any sense. No medical use and significant harm? How is marijuana in the same place on the schedule as heroin? But therein lies the incoherence of American drug laws. When LSD was invented in the 1930s, it was invented as a medicine, but in the 1960s it basically became a party drug. In the 1960s, the drug was criminalized, and the reason it was criminalized has everything to do with what was going on politically and socially in the country. So when Timothy Leary stands up in front of the massive crowd at the Human Be In at San Francisco and says ”Turn On, Tune In, and Drop Out” to a group of basically all young people —  and all white young people —  that’s very important. They start taking LSD, and more importantly they start protesting the war, and their parents —  nice,   white parents —  freak out, and it becomes a scapegoat for this moment of social upheaval and it’s thus criminalized. It’s interesting because the criminalization of LSD is not like the criminalization of marijuana, the criminalization of cocaine, the criminalization of opium. Those drugs were specifically tied to different minority groups. Marijuana [criminalization] was a way to attack Mexican Americans, and cocaine was really a way to attack  . LSD came from a different place. The idea that your kid would take a drug and start to trip just scared the shit out of everybody, so it became criminalized. And as soon as something is placed on Schedule I, all research grinds to a halt. Khazan: How are the health risks of microdosing different from regular dosing? Waldman: When I went into this, I assumed I was going to find all of these terrible things about the health risks of LSD, but if you took a microdose, maybe you could ameliorate those risks. It turns out actually that there has never been a recorded incident of a fatal overdose of LSD. If I tried to think about what the health risks might be, it’s not so much physical, it’s not like MDMA, which causes a range of physical side effects. The danger, such as it is, is most closely related to something that was once called LSD psychosis. If you have a hallucinatory experience in an uncomfortable setting, it can be terrifying. The anxiety and the fear of that unpleasant experience can have emotional repercussions, particularly if you’re someone with a mental illness. So that’s what I was worried about. Could it trigger some kind of anxiety in me that would be worse than the profound despair I find myself in now? But the anxiety response is to the hallucination itself and to the feelings engendered by the hallucination, and microdosing isn’t hallucinatory at all. And even though I’d read that a million times, I didn’t believe it until I took it. I mean you’re taking LSD, aren’t the walls gonna breathe? The only thing that I noticed was it was easier for me to see the beauty in my natural world. I live in Northern California, it’s ridiculously beautiful. You walk out my door and there’s jasmine everywhere, the smell is overwhelming. And 99. 999 percent of the time, I don’t even notice. When I was microdosing I would stop and say, ”wow, that is a beautiful redwood tree.” And again, here I am, back in that horrible mindfulness place where I have to use that word. Khazan: Sometimes it’s the only one that fits. Have you listened to the Reply All podcast episode where they microdose and have kind of a bad time? Waldman: Yeah, I have. Khazan: What did you think of that, how do you think your experience was different? Waldman: First of all, here’s a little tip: Don’t take double the microdose and like do something like drive on a car on a really tiresome road trip. That seems like a mistake. First of all, we don’t know that what they took was LSD, because they didn’t test it. They also took too much. They were trying to keep it a secret from their colleagues, and that maybe enhanced their own anxiety. [The microdose] is a little activating. If you’ve ever taken Adderall or Ritalin, I think for me it was not dissimilar to that, but much less intense. So I think if you’re someone who doesn’t normally experience those feelings of activation, then that might be disconcerting and unpleasant. But, you know, no drug is for everyone. Khazan: Given your history as a public defender working on drug cases, while you were doing this did you ever get paranoid and think ”I’m gonna get arrested!” Waldman: I decided that I didn’t want to stop but when my bottle ran out, because I was feeling so much better and I cannot understate how depressed I was. It was the closest I’ve ever come to being suicidal. I would Google the effects of suicide on younger children and older children, because I have both. But I do think I would have destroyed my marriage as a kind of suicide because it’s so important to me, and because I love my husband so much, and my marriage is such a source of comfort and strength. I think destroying the thing that made me feel the most safe in the world was how I would have effectively committed suicide. But I woke up and took the dose, and 90 minutes later, the fog lifted. I hadn’t felt like that for months and months and months. So at the end of 30 days, I was like fuck that, I am not going back to that pit. I’m going to go buy drugs. So I found a person, a number, and I texted the number, and the individual who I called “Lucy” texted me back, and I was all set to go buy drugs. I think I wanted five doses or ten doses, which I thought would carry me for a year. Khazan: And they were like, “can you buy 60 doses?” Waldman: ”Yeah, I can’t separate it, could you take 60?” And that pumping up the figure is just what happened to every one of my clients [when I was a defense lawyer]. That like, ”I wanna buy a little methamphetamine” . .. “oh here take a lot!” That’s what you do when you wanna get someone into a mandatory minimum [jail sentence]. So I was in my very lovely neighborhood in Berkeley, outside a Lululemon, when I decided that the mighty forces of the DEA had been marshaled to bring down this middle class,   mom of four. I ran home and sat in bed and readied myself for incarceration. I was like, “Alright, you’ll be able to read, there’s lots to read. You’re a lawyer, you can help people, there are a lot of people in jail who need legal help. You can’t practice law, but you can surely be like a jailhouse lawyer.” I was sitting there figuring out how I was going to turn my period of incarceration into an altruistic enterprise. I’m constitutionally incapable of buying illegal drugs. I’ve just never bought any illegal drugs. Anything I’ve ever taken has just been given to me. Khazan: The kind of shady nature of this, I think, does discourage people from trying it because it’s not fun to try to acquire. Waldman: It’s so shady. It’s true. The big thing I say to my kids, every time I say goodbye to them is ”use a condom, test your molly.” Because I really believe that one of the most problematic side effects of criminalization is no one knows what they’re taking and especially now when it’s so much cheaper and easier for criminal enterprises to create these “alphabetamines,” some of which are incredibly dangerous. Synthetic cannabinoids are just a nightmare. I live in fear that one of my kids is gonna decide they’re gonna take molly one night and end up ingesting one of those. Khazan: Are you still worried about getting into legal trouble, having published this book? Waldman: So on November 7, I was quite confident that nothing was going to happen. I think it’s grandiose to imagine that I am a high priority of Jeff Sessions. That said, we have just elected a president whose attorney general is so retrograde, such a dinosaur in his thinking about the drug war, that anything is possible. A consensus had formed before this election that the war on drugs was costly and ineffective. And simultaneously with electing Donald Trump and bringing in Jeff Sessions, we also legalized marijuana in a bunch of states. So it’s a really schizophrenic moment in history. So yeah, I think it’s possible. Khazan: I noticed that a couple times in the book when you talked about your experiment with people, the reactions were sort of mixed. You almost felt like people were judging you a little bit. Now that it’s a little more public and there’s a book about it, are people still judging you or have they become more accepting? Waldman: There are certainly people who will judge. Some people say, “Oh that Ayelet Waldman, being confrontational again, being outrageous again,” as if that were my goal. The response from people who have dealt with issues like depression has been overwhelming and wonderful. Because even if they have no interest in doing something like this, they know that other people who suffer from depression, from anxiety, from bipolar disorder, they know what it’s like to be desperately searching for a way to feel better. You know my parents, my   parents, were so wonderful and supportive and nonjudgmental. And judgment is built into the Waldman DNA even more assertively than mental illness. And they were really wonderful. Khazan: I read that you’re not saying when this took place, but to the extent that you’re able to share, have the effects lasted? How long did they last? Waldman: It’s kind of interesting, the effects of the drugs have not lasted. LSD does not hang around in your system like that, but the effects of the end of the depression have lasted. I have not cycled into as low as a mood since I don’t attribute that as much to LSD as to the insight brought about by that   experiment. Even when my mood has dropped since then, I’ve had a much clearer image in my mind of what not being depressed is like, so that’s one thing. It’s allowed me since then to be somewhat less reactive and somewhat less impulsive. I still feel as impulsive, but for some reason since then, and with a tremendous amount of work using all these other therapeutic modalities that are boring and annoying but can be effective if you use them, I have been able to put the brakes on more inappropriate behaviors. I still make tons of mistakes. I’ll yell at my husband, but we don’t have the same kind of fights really, it doesn’t build to the same kind of place, or if it does I know how to repair without going to a place of suicidal ideation. I’m in this therapy now that’s called dialectical behavioral therapy, and for some reason since this experience I’ve been more adept at the tools, and I’ve been more able to force myself to do them. That being said, if it were legal, I would still be doing it, no doubt."
53358,73541,Can Evangelicals Help Trump Thaw Relations With Russia?,Atlantic,Jonathan Merritt,2017-01-14,2017.0,1.0,,"   On March 8, 1983, Ronald Reagan stood before an audience of evangelicals and declared that the Soviet government was the “focus of evil in the modern world. ” The arena erupted in unsurprising applause, standing ovations, and echoes of the hymn “Onward Christian Soldiers. ” While many conservatives supported a hardline stance on the Soviet Union, the religious right gave Reagan the moral backing he needed to reignite the Cold War. Pastors preached sermons about the godless, evil Russians. The 3. 5   National Association of Evangelicals —  who invited Reagan to address its annual gathering, where he gave that 1983 speech —  became “a leading   voice. ” And the Moral Majority purchased   advertisements in newspapers using charged religious language to frame the issues. “Recognizing the inherently moral nature of debates about nuclear weapons, the Moral Majority gave Reagan’s policies the weight of their moral authority,” as historian Jeremy Hatfield has observed. The Atlantic  Politics  Policy Daily: Survey Says . .. Housing Policy! More than three decades later, another Republican prepares to move into the White House, but unlike Reagan,   Donald Trump seems to be cozying up to the former Soviet Union. If this weren’t enough to contradict Reagan’s legacy, some of his most loyal Cold War allies —  conservative Christians —  have advocated building bridges with Russia. As the new administration makes its plans, their collective moral voice may be just what Trump needs to thaw relations with the big bear across the sea. Given how the Republican Party has lionized Reagan, it’s difficult to imagine the party’s top leader embracing the country his predecessor once stood against. And yet, Trump has gone out of his way to laud Russian President Vladimir Putin on numerous occasions, even giving his leadership an “A” rating. Last month, Trump praised Putin as “very smart” for delaying his response to new American sanctions against Russia. And Putin has returned the favor, calling Trump a “clever man” and “talented. ” If that weren’t enough to make the Gipper roll over in his grave, Trump has even seemingly sided with Russia over his own government. After U. S. intelligence officials announced that Russia hacked into Democratic officials’ emails to influence the November election, the   challenged their assessment. When American officials said that   forces in Ukraine shot down a Malaysia Airlines flight in 2015, Trump claimed, “no one really knows who did it. ” When he was asked about Putin killing dissenters, Trump replied, “Well, I think our country does plenty of killing also. ” And, of course, Trump has famously claimed that Putin is a stronger leader than President Barack Obama. Conservative Christians, including   evangelical leaders, have similarly defended Russia and decried the outgoing American president. Franklin Graham, the son of famed evangelist Billy Graham, praised Putin in a 2014   for enacting harsh   laws: Isn’t it sad, though, that America’s own morality has fallen so far that on this issue —  protecting children from any homosexual agenda or propaganda —  Russia’s standard is higher than our own? In my opinion, Putin is right on these issues. Obviously, he may be wrong about many things, but he has taken a stand to protect his nation’s children from the damaging effects of any gay and lesbian agenda. Graham also reportedly attacked Obama while visiting Russia —  claiming, according to Russian press, that Obama “promotes atheism. ” Nary a peep was heard from conservative Christians in response to Graham criticizing an American president before a foreign audience. Which is to say, they did not give Graham the treatment many gave the Dixie Chicks when the singers criticized George W. Bush while abroad. The protection against the LGBT “agenda” that Graham referenced is a 2013 “gay propaganda” law that makes it illegal in Russia to regard straight and   relationships as equal or disseminate materials promoting gay rights. The law is part of a Russian   crackdown on LGBT rights that has led to an increase in violence against gays and lesbians —  including beatings, abductions, and public humiliation. The year the law was passed, the World Congress of Families announced it would host its annual conference in Russia. (Though after much controversy, they canceled the gathering.) Headquartered in Rockford, Illinois, the WCF has been one of the most powerful   groups fighting the legalizations of gay marriage and abortion abroad since its founding in 1997. The WCF has helped organize several events in Russia since 2010, and WCF’s executive director said he hoped American evangelicals would be “true allies” in Russia’s fight to protect Christian values.   discrimination of gays and lesbians doesn’t sound like a Christian value. But some prominent evangelicals seem to regard it as such, including Bryan Fischer, spokesman for the evangelical American Family Association, who said the propaganda law was the type of “public policy that we’ve been advocating” —  and might not have gone far enough. And Peter LaBarbera of Americans for the Truth About Homosexuality, who backed the legislation. And the American Center for Law and Justice, a prominent evangelical legal group that has supported some of Putin’s   measures. And Brian Brown,   of the National Organization for Marriage, who actually traveled to Russia to testify on behalf of   legislation and called Putin a “lion of Christianity. ” In recent days, other evangelical leaders have also joined the   chorus. Televangelist Jim Bakker, for example, expressed excitement that Putin might help Trump usher in the end times and hasten the second coming of Jesus. Ted Baehr, founder of MovieGuide and America’s most prominent evangelical film critic, has publicly supported Russia, too: He traveled there recently on a speaking tour, vowed to use his organization to protect Russian families from     values, and has even encouraged the creation of a “Christian Oscar” in the country. And pastor Rick Joyner declared that “there is much more freedom of religion in Russia than there is in America,” where “we no longer have freedom of speech. ” Joyner’s assertion may be the most bizarre given that the Kremlin enacted a law just this year that dramatically reduces religious freedom to restrict evangelization efforts outside of church. From religious liberty to LGBT rights, Russia is just as totalitarian as it ever was, but this doesn’t seem to matter to some evangelicals. Which means that the religious right —  a force that helped Reagan defeat Mikhail Gorbachev’s oppressive regime —  might help Trump forge strong bonds with Putin’s oppressive regime. Oh, irony of ironies. Not all evangelical leaders are smitten with Russia. But even some who aren’t keen on Putin still support Trump’s efforts to strengthen ties. Robert Jeffress, a Trump supporter and megachurch pastor in Dallas, Texas, told me he is not sympathetic toward Moscow’s stances on religious freedom or LGBT issues. Still, he supports the   firming up the United States’ relationship with the country. “I do not fault   Trump for trying to find common ground with Russia —  or any nation, especially when it comes to eradicating ISIS,” Jeffress said via email. “In a nuclear world, trying to build bridges with your enemies is a virtue, not a vice —  as long as those bridges do not provide a pathway for your enemies to destroy you. ” Jerry Falwell Jr. president of Liberty University, the largest evangelical college in the United States, is concerned with Russia’s restrictions on religious liberty calls their treatment of sexual minorities “barbaric” and says he doesn’t trust Putin’s intentions. But Falwell still supports the Trump administration potentially getting closer to Putin’s government. “I look at Trump more as a very, very, very shrewd and calculating businessman, and I think any good businessman would try to open up opportunities for negotiation and for ” Falwell told me. “I think that’s all he’s tried to do with Putin. I think he’s smart enough to know that you can’t even negotiate if you don’t have a relationship. ” Falwell’s late father was the founder of the Moral Majority. He was tasked by Reagan himself to convince evangelicals to support a hardline approach to the Soviet Union, and he literally wrote the book on why Christians should be wary of Russia. But when asked what his father’s position would be if he were still alive, the younger Falwell said his dad would support Trump forging a relationship with Putin for the purpose of negotiating world affairs. Religion has influenced politics since the nation’s founding. As George Washington said in his 1796 farewell address, “Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. ” Alexis de Tocqueville noted religion will play an important role in American politics so long as the United States remains a country comprised of religious citizens. And as historians Andrew Preston, Bruce Schulman, and Julian Zelizer write in Faithful Republic: Religion and Politics in Modern America: Religious Americans contribute to national debates on ethics, morals, economics, the size and proper role of government, and foreign affairs. Either individually or collectively, they bring their influence to bear on the political process by making their views known to politicians and government officials —  many of whom are themselves religious, or at least conversant with the history, values, and prerogatives of religious communities. A president might support a law or   strategy because it is politically expedient. But religious leaders can stamp “thus saith the Lord” on it and rally their large constituencies to the cause, as they did toward the end of the Cold War. The religious right just helped elect Donald Trump in the most stunning upset in modern American politics. Now they may help their president build a closer relationship with Russia than the United States has seen in a  ."
53359,73547,Former Intel Chief: Community Caught Between ’Scylla and Charybdis’ on Trump Dossier,Atlantic,Kathy Gilsinan,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"There were two   highly sensitive documents circulating in Washington in early January, both relating to Donald Trump and the Russians. The first, a classified report by the U. S. intelligence community, contained evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 United States election, which intelligence officials have publicly concluded was intended to help Trump win the presidency. The second, a   unverified opposition research report compiled by a private intelligence firm, contained explosive personal and financial allegations about the   in some cases allegedly gathered by or in the possession of Russian intelligence.   The Biggest Intelligence Questions Raised by the Trump Dossier, And what has publicly linked these two reports of different genres is two pages. That was the length of an “annex” appended to the classified government document on Russian election hacking, reportedly summarizing some allegations from the other document, the private firm’s dossier on Trump. And it was a news leak about those two pages that precipitated the publication of the full opposition dossier. Though members of the intelligence community had been made aware of the dossier as far back as August 2016, James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, emphasized this week that the dossier was not, itself, “an intelligence community product” —  American intelligence officials had neither produced nor verified the contents of the report, but summarized parts to provide policymakers with the “fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security. ” (Further confusing matters, it appears a former British intelligence official did produce it.) As Stanford’s Amy Zegart notes, all intelligence is information, but not all information is intelligence. So what information qualifies? And how does the intelligence community process or try to verify alleged information like what’s in the Trump dossier? I spoke about these and other questions with Dennis Blair, who was the director of national intelligence, overseeing the intelligence community, in 2010 and 2011. A condensed and edited transcript of our conversation follows. Kathy Gilsinan: What distinguishes the Trump dossier from an intelligence product? Dennis Blair: An intelligence product is written to answer a specific question that’s of interest either to policymakers or to operational leaders in the field, and it generally starts with a particular intelligence requirement: “What will ISIS do next?” at the high end, down to “Where are the IEDs in Aleppo?” on the low end. So the intelligence community doesn’t just wander off and write about what catches its fancy. It’s trying to provide information to help better decisions. On the information that goes into an intelligence report, it’s a combination of intelligence that’s gathered through clandestine means, whether it be signals intelligence, where you copy an email or tap a phone or human intelligence, where you have a spy talking to you or technical intelligence, like a picture that you interpret —  that’s the information that you go out and gather. And you blend that with information that’s available to most any expert in the field —  databases that are put together by academic institutions or businesses in some cases, observations from people in the field who are not intelligence officers, but are knowledgeable observers. It starts with those sources of intelligence, and then it has to come to some sort of an assessment of answering a question: “Here’s where the IEDs are,” “this is what we think ISIS will do. ” So that’s 99 percent of what the intelligence community spends its time doing. But occasionally, just in the course of [their] business, people in the intelligence community run across documents or stories that are just generally   that clearly are going to be of interest to policymakers. And when you find something about the actions of your   that certainly falls squarely in that category. So then you have to make a decision —  generally at a high level in the intelligence community —  as to what you do with it. Gilsinan: So we have this mysterious dossier from a private intelligence company that approaches the FBI in Rome, sometime in August in 2016. Generally speaking, how would the community —  the FBI in this case —  process something like that? Blair: It would be turned into a field report describing how it arrived, and then that context for how it showed up [would be forwarded] along with the document itself or evidence of other kinds, and that would be sent in a field report to the analytical center at headquarters. Something this explosive and this big would be sent at fairly high levels there would be extra precautions taken to make sure that it’s not widely disseminated. It would get to leadership within the FBI and then in the intelligence community pretty quickly. Gilsinan: Suppose I were some guy in Rome in August 2016 and I went to the FBI with some explosive allegations that I had totally made up. Would that reach high levels? How do you know when to take information seriously enough to waste the boss’s time with it, essentially? Blair: That’s a tricky one. You would give [it] an initial screening. If the guy who walked in the door was drooling,   not making sense, and there were a lot of misspellings and typos in the document itself, you’d probably put it in a circular file right away. But if it’s something that has a superficial veracity to it and seems like it might be true, if you’re sitting there as the legal attaché in Rome, you say, “Wow, this is really hot. ” The main thing is that it involves a U. S. citizen, and as soon as something involves a U. S. citizen, a whole different set of procedures [goes] into play. Whether it involves the   or something came across with your [Kathy Gilsinan’s] name on it, it simply cannot be used —  it cannot be put into a normal intelligence report, because the United States does not collect or report on Americans. So there are two aspects of it. Number one, it was about a U. S. citizen number two, it was about our   [then the Republican presidential nominee]. For example, sometimes the NSA will obtain signals intelligence which says something about an American, or the NSA or CIA has a spy report that talks about an American citizen. What’s done in those cases is that the identity of the citizen is blocked out in the original report, and then [determining] who that American really is requires a set of extraordinary permissions at a very high level within the community. But you can imagine, if you sent this up saying    went to    a hotel, it’d be pretty [thinly] that you’d actually be able disguise who it was about. Therefore you would simply keep the whole thing in a very restricted channel, and send it up to your boss and say, “What the hell do we do with this?” Gilsinan: But can the FBI collect information on American citizens? Blair: Only if it has a warrant. The only way the FBI could go out and collect the information on what Americans are doing overseas, for example, would be if they went to a judge [and] got a warrant based on reasonable suspicion that a crime was being committed. In that case, they could then conduct surveillance, put a listening bug into a room. But that’s all done with the FBI —  the   agency —  and they’re either investigating a crime, or if they have a suspicion, they have to go through the warrant process that we’re all familiar with. And that’s true for overseas investigation as well as for domestic ones. Gilsinan: And the FBI tried to get a warrant in this case? Blair: Oh, did they? Gilsinan: They tried to get a FISA warrant, and the judge rejected their request. Blair: Good, good, the FISA system works. Gilsinan: So then it sounds like there’s not much they could do to investigate this, right? The reports that I’m reading say, “the FBI had been trying to check this out and hadn’t been able to verify anything. ” What you’re saying seems to suggest that they wouldn’t legally be able to check it out anyway? Blair: Correct. My understanding is that there’s no evidence that a crime was committed, there’s no suspicion, so they don’t have any grounds to take it any further. A field office wouldn’t sit on something like this and make up its own ideas. This would be handled at headquarters. Based on what you said and what I know about it, I don’t see any compelling rationale to investigate it. That’s stuff that reporters investigate, not the FBI. Gilsinan: So there are the salacious allegations, but there are also allegations in the document of people in the Trump campaign accepting money or colluding with Russia, which would be a crime, right? In which case the FBI could’ve investigated that, but they would’ve still needed a warrant. Blair: I haven’t read this document. If a document comes across and says a crime has been committed, then the FBI has initial grounds to investigate and there are things they can do without a warrant. Just to choose [an] example, if a document that they receive in an unexpected fashion says that a bank robbery occurred a couple of weeks ago, then it’s worth checking with the bank, and you can do that without a warrant. But then the minute you go further into having to take any action that invades the privacy of a suspect, then you have to have a warrant. Gilsinan: So hypothetically, the FBI could’ve asked the Ritz Carlton Moscow, “Who showed up?” —   right? Blair: Yeah, was there a reservation in this person’s name on this date? That’s sort of an easy one to check without violating privacy, and puts you in the ballpark of reality on something like this. Gilsinan: But then they would have to stop there? Like, suppose the answer was yes. Then what happens? Blair: Well, suppose the answer was, “We’re not going to tell you our guest records are private. ” Then they would have had to have gotten a warrant, convince the judge it was probable enough that they could proceed. Gilsinan: What’s your reaction as an intelligence professional about how this got out? You were saying that, within the intelligence community, this kind of thing would be very closely held, and yet it was bouncing around DC for a couple of months. What’s your feeling on that? How could that happen? Blair: The report itself was provided to several news organizations in addition to the FBI. On the [question of] how did the information get out that [a briefing summarizing the dossier’s conclusions] was provided to the   [by intelligence officials] I guess you look at it two ways. The way I’ve always found most fruitful is the cui bono test: Who would either get an advantage or get a kick out of leaking it? The people who knew about [the briefing] within the intelligence community were pretty highly placed. They’ve been involved in public spats with the president[ ]. They know it’s not good for them or for the   or for their future relationships, so why in the world would they put this out and make their lives even more difficult? So what does that lead you to? That leads you to   people who know about it but are not involved substantively and just get a kick out of seeing shitstorms in the paper and being able to say to their buddies over a beer, “You know that big story? I did that. ” That does happen. You do have cipher clerks who handle it, and secretaries who set up meetings and so on, and I’ve found over time that there are some who just get a kick out of reading awful stuff in the press, as long as it was they who provided it. And that could’ve been on the intelligence side or on the [side of]   Trump’s [transition team]. The way you do leak investigations is you go through the real police detective work of “Okay, let’s get a copy of every document, let’s trace every time it was sent, who was on the distribution list, every meeting in which it was discussed —  what was the attendance list? Let’s go out and talk to all of them. ” Gilsinan: But [the document itself] could also have come from the private company itself or from the campaigns it was working for —  not necessarily a leak from the intel community. What to make of the fact that the allegations were taken seriously enough that officials felt they had to brief the president and the  ? Blair: There is no more powerful force in Washington than, “What if this comes out somehow and I was found not to have done my utmost?” Just think of the position that the intelligence leadership has been in for the last couple of weeks. I’m sure they sat around and thought, “What if we sat on this [and] it comes out somehow that we were sitting on it, [and] the   said, ‘You knew about this and you didn’t tell me that it was out there? ’” Those were the Scylla and a Charybdis that they were caught between, and I can very much understand a decision to provide it to the  . They clearly, based on what they’ve said, made all of the qualifications of, “We haven’t investigated this this is not verified but boss, you need to know this is out there. ” I think they made that call, rather than saying, “Let’s bury this. ” Because then I think the chances within the intelligence community of a leak would be much greater, especially in the FBI which has this sort of sense of entitlement among a lot of its agents that they know more than their director does. They’re happy to tell you news people how they do it happens all the time. Gilsinan: Anything else? Blair: I would just give you one of Blair’s Laws developed over the years: If there is a choice in explaining a government action between a Machiavellian, clever, ingenious plot to achieve that result and sort of blind, bumbling,   incompetence, choose number two all the time."
53360,73555,Why Europe Is Worried About Donald Trump’s Latest Remarks,Atlantic,Krishnadev Calamur,2017-01-16,2017.0,1.0,,"  Donald Trump hasn’t been shy about sharing his views about the world, in general, and Europe, in particular. He was criticized during the presidential campaign for questioning the value of NATO, praising the U. K.’s decision to leave the EU, and linking terrorist attacks to the million or so   who have arrived in Europe since 2015. Trump’s supporters and political analysts attributed those comments to   rhetoric, and said he would pivot on these and other issues before the general election. But with less than a week before the inauguration at which he’ll be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, Trump gave a joint interview to The Times (of London) and Bild, the   German tabloid, during which he described NATO as “obsolete,” called the EU “basically a vehicle for Germany,” and said other countries would follow the U. K.’s lead and leave the bloc. Trump’s remarks about the Atlantic alliance don’t quite amount to the rejection of the group, nor did he suggest the U. S. might abrogate its treaty obligations to its NATO partners as he appeared to last July. Indeed, when asked by the two publications if the U. S. would guarantee Europe’s defense in the future, as it has since the end of World War II, Trump responded: “Yeah, I feel very strongly toward Europe  —   very strongly toward Europe, yes. ” But that came after he called NATO “obsolete,” and noted that only five of its 22 members —  the U. S. Greece, Estonia, Poland, and the U. K. —  were spending their share on defense, which under NATO’s guidelines constitutes 2 percent of GDP. Trump’s remarks appear to conflict with those of James Mattis, the retired Marine Corps general who is his nominee for defense secretary, who said last week during his confirmation hearing that “if NATO didn’t exist today, we’d have to create it. ” Mattis accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of trying to break up NATO —  and it’s that possibility that many European officials fear, as well. Russia’s invasion and annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014, its continued support of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, speculation that it has territorial designs over the Baltic states and Scandinavian countries, and its support of Syrian President Bashar   have all led to the belief that Russian interests are at odds with Western interests. Traditionally, it was the U. S. that was the bulwark against possible Russian aggression in Europe —  and European leaders fear Trump will not keep that commitment. German Foreign Minister   Steinmeier said Trump’s remarks “caused astonishment and excitement, not just in Brussels,” where both the EU and NATO have their headquarters. NATO, he said, had heard the comments “with concern. ” He added: “This is in contradiction with what [Mattis] said in his hearing in Washington only some days ago and we have to see what will be the consequences for American policy. ” Trump’s past remarks about Russia haven’t elicited much confidence, either. He’s suggested he’d recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea, praised Putin as a strong leader, and appeared for a time to take Russia’s word that it didn’t interfere in the U. S. election though the intelligence agencies that he’ll soon be running have repeatedly said the opposite. He appeared to suggest in his latest interview that he’d be open to lifting sanctions against Russia in exchange for “some good deals. ” “For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that’s part of it,” he said. “But you do have sanctions and Russia’s hurting very badly right now because of sanctions, but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit. ” Then there’s the future of the EU. The political establishment in Europe and the U. K. are still reeling from last summer’s vote by Britons to leave the EU. Although the nature of the U. K.’s future relationship with the bloc is unclear, and the source of much political debate, the economic impact, so far, has been far from the catastrophe that was predicted before the vote. Trump was an early supporter of Brexit —  and his interview this week with the Times was given to Michael Gove, the U. K. lawmaker who was a lead campaigner for the “Leave” movement. He doubled down on his earlier comments in his interview.   “People don’t want to have other people coming in and destroying their country,” he said. Adding later: “People, countries want their own identity and the U. K. wanted its own identity but, I do believe this, if they hadn’t been forced to take in all of the refugees, so many, with all the problems that it, you know, entails, I think that you wouldn’t have a Brexit. It probably could have worked out but, this was the final straw, this was the final straw that broke the camel’s back. “I think people want, people want their own identity, so if you ask me, others, I believe others will leave. ” Trump appears to be conflating thelongstanding opposition to immigration among some U. K. voters to increased immigration to its refugee policy. The U. K. pledged to resettle 20, 000 Syrian refugees last year, far fewer than other major European nations —  though the fate of that commitment is unclear. Trump also said in the interview that he doesn’t care one way or the other whether the EU is a single entity or several countries. U. S. administrations of both parties have promoted European unity for decades —  though there have areas of disagreement.   “Personally, I don’t think it [a stronger EU versus stronger nation states] matters much for the United States,” Trump said. “I never thought it mattered. Look, the EU was formed, partially, to beat the United States on trade, OK? So, I don’t really care whether it’s separate or together, to me it doesn’t matter. ” Those comments, in particular, appear to have rankled in Europe, where support for EU membership is high in most member states, even if there’s resentment toward some EU policies. French Foreign Minister   Ayrault said: “The best response is European unity. ” Speaking in Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel said, “We Europeans have our fate in our own hands. ” Merkel came in for special mention in Trump’s interview. He criticized the German chancellor’s   policy for Syrian refugees, calling it a “one very catastrophic mistake. ” He also described the refugees who are fleeing more than five years of civil war as “illegals. ” He elaborated on those comments about Merkel, who is facing   this year and opposition after several terrorist attacks in the country. “I think it was a big mistake for Germany,” he said of the policy. “And   …     I think we should have built safe zones in Syria.   …     Would have been a lot less expensive than the trauma that Germany’s going through now. ” John Kerry, the U. S. secretary of state, criticized the remarks: “I thought frankly it was inappropriate for a president elect of the United States to be stepping into the politics of other countries in a quite direct manner,” he said on CNN. “He will have to speak to that, as of Friday he is responsible for that relationship. ” But of all the comments Trump made in his interview to the Times and Bild, it’s his remarks about trade that are most likely to upset Germany and others in Europe. ” When asked about BMW’s plans to open a facility in Mexico in 2019, Trump responded: “I would tell them, don’t waste their time and money —  unless they want to sell to other countries, that’s fine —  if they want to open in Mexico   …     but I would tell BMW if they think they’re gonna build a plant in Mexico and sell cars into the U. S. without a 35 per cent tax, it’s not gonna happen, it’s not gonna happen.   …     They can build cars for the U. S. but they’ll be paying a 35 percent tax on every car that comes into the country. ” The remarks caused shares in BMW and other German carmakers to fall. The EU is the U. S.’s largest trading partner, and as such German officials would be likely to retaliate against a   tax on the automaker. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s deputy chancellor and minister for the economy, told Bild in a separate interview that BMW’s largest factory was already in the U. S. “The U. S. car industry would have a bad awakening if all the supply parts that aren’t being built in the U. S. were to suddenly come with a 35 percent tariff,” he said. “I believe it would make the U. S. car industry weaker, worse, and above all more expensive. ” When asked about Trump’s remarks that trade between the two countries was “unfair” because “you go down Fifth Avenue, [and] everybody has a   [but] how many Chevrolets do you see in Germany?” Gabriel responded that U. S. automakers should “build better cars. ”"
53361,73556,Toni Erdmann Is a Comedy Experience Unlike Any Other,Atlantic,David Sims,2017-01-16,2017.0,1.0,,"Toni Erdmann is a tough film to explain. It aims to confound, to discombobulate, to make you laugh and wonder what exactly you think is so amusing —  to   things, in short. That’s the goal of both the film and the title character, a parody persona adopted by an eccentric divorced dad to both repel, and earn the love of, his disapproving daughter. Maren Ade’s comedy sounds actively repellent on paper —  it’s from Germany (not a country that produces a lot of crossover comedies) it’s nearly three hours long, and it centers in part on the westernization of Europe’s eastern bloc by insidious, but bland, capitalist consultants. So why is it so unbelievably funny and heartwarming? It’s because Toni Erdmann is legitimately unlike any comedy I had ever seen before, as hyperbolic as that may sound. Describe it in passing, and it might sound like many a fuzzy Hollywood affair, a tale of a prankster father and   daughter learning to reconnect (in fact, its rumored American remake may well end up in that lane). But Toni Erdmann draws so much of its humor from refusing to cut away from a scene that might seem irrelevant or boring, or to land on an easy punchline. It’s some new, evolved form of awkward comedy that doesn’t strive to make the audience wince, but rather lives in every joyously strange, unsettling moment. Comedy: Slowly Becoming Less of a Boy’s Club, To summarize the plot of Toni Erdmann would be to spoil some of its juicy surprises. It would also take a while, since Ade’s film is not only very long, but also steeped in tiny details, taking stock of two people’s    lives with occasional flourishes of absurdity. It follows Winfried Conradi (Peter Simonischek) a divorced music teacher living in Germany with a penchant for   pranks, often involving a set of ridiculous fake teeth and other wild costumes. Winfried is   from his daughter Ines (Sandra Hüller) a   business consultant currently posted in Bucharest, Romania, where she’s assisting in the creeping privatization of the country’s oil industry. He decides to visit her and be his usual annoying self, confusing her   and clients with his pranks and generally serving as a bother. After a while (this is a long movie, so it really is a while) he leaves, and rather than follow him back to Germany, the film lingers with Ines, steeping the audience in the particulars of her job and her   politics for another 20 minutes or so. It’s so mundane that it feels bewildering —  Ade skillfully gets the audience to actually pay attention to what Ines is up to, to begin to understand the tedious, sophistic details of her work, and her strengths and defects in the workplace. You’re glued to the action precisely because you cannot figure out what is going on —  when the next twist is coming, what happened to Winfried, and whether or not this film is going to return to the strained   relationship it seemed to be using as a plot foundation. It does eventually do that, but as with every story turn in this film, the manner in which it happens is hilariously disorienting. As already mentioned, Winfried has another personality he occasionally inhabits, a man named Toni Erdmann who serves as some parody of an eccentric tycoon, and Toni begins to spend an uncomfortable amount of time in Bucharest. If Ines and her company represent the grinding gears of westernization in a country still defined by the collectivization of its Soviet past, Toni Erdmann is some   vision of the future Ines is helping to build. He’s an uncouth, shambling character, but he’s one that always commands the attention of every room he’s in, simply because of his bizarre, assured confidence. This is not to say Toni Erdmann is explicitly political. The moments spent looking at the minutiae of Ines’s work life are fascinating precisely because they’re so granular Ade is happy to let viewers pore over whatever interests them most and set aside the rest. It’s a film about how a powerful woman navigates the workplace, but one that doesn’t pass judgment about how she does it. The movie takes an almost sick pleasure in the absurdities of modern life, even when they border on the tragic. Toni Erdmann builds to an incredible finale —  a set piece that pulls together all these disparate themes into a outrageous piece of high comedy, a hilarious shattering of bourgeois norms that feels like something out of a Luis Buñuel film. Then it keeps on going for another 15 puzzling minutes, rather than capitalizing on its transcendent climax. The movie is subversive to the last, finding laughs by taking life as it is, from slapstick hijinks to dull boardroom meetings —  making it a truly original comic experience."
53362,73557,How Mass Incarceration Pushes Black Children Further Behind in School,Atlantic,Melinda D. Anderson,2017-01-16,2017.0,1.0,,"In the summer of 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered the closing remarks at the March on Washington. More than 200, 000 people gathered to cast a national spotlight on and mobilize resistance to Jim Crow, racist laws and policies that disenfranchised black Americans and mandated segregated housing, schools, and employment. Today, more than 50 years later, remnants of Jim Crow segregation persist in the form of mass incarceration —  the imprisonment of millions of Americans, overwhelmingly and disproportionately black adults, in local, state, and federal prisons. The U. S. incarceration rate is more than five times higher than that in most of the world’s nations, despite a crime rate that’s comparable to other politically stable, industrialized countries. And among the swelling number of incarcerated men and women is a vast number of parents. In 2015, The Atlantic’s Alia Wong highlighted a study from Child Trends that found that one in nine black children has had a parent in jail or prison, about twice as high as that for white children. For black adolescents ages 12 through 17, it’s nearly one in seven. Predictably, this has implications for America’s classrooms. In a new report, researchers from the   Economic Policy Institute (EPI) argue that mass incarceration is a chief contributor to the racial gaps in academic performance between black and white students. The study outlines a wide array of adverse effects for children of incarcerated parents and underscores how   policy and education policy are linked. How Parental Incarceration Affects a Child’s Education, “Education policymakers and many educators continue to insist that in order to narrow the achievement gap, we must tinker with what is happening in the classroom   …     improve the way schools are functioning,” said the EPI research associate Leila Morsy, the report’s   and a lecturer at the University of New South Wales. “[Yet] making changes to   policy can make as much, if not more, of a difference [for children]. ”Acknowledging that a significant body of research already exists on the discriminatory system that incarcerates black men at six times the rate of white men, and about 2. 5 times the rate of Hispanic men, Morsy and her colleague trained their sights on “the disparate impact that this has on children, and how African American children suffer disproportionately. ” Morsy said the EPI study is the first of its kind to compile all of the harms children of imprisoned parents suffer —  academic, behavioral, and health impediments —  and to draw a direct link between parental incarceration and children doing worse in school. The report shows that having an incarcerated parent translates to a range of learning obstacles and health challenges. After a parent is imprisoned, children’s   averages fall, as the likelihood of dropping out of school rises. Compared to children of   parents, these youth show a higher incidence of anxiety (51 percent more likely) and depression (43 percent) and are considerably more likely to be diagnosed with   stress disorder (72 percent)   hyperactivity disorder (48 percent) and behavioral issues (43 percent). The analysis also finds that incarcerating parents leads to intergenerational trauma. Children of incarcerated adults are at greater risk for economic instability due to the loss of their family’s main income provider, and as a result more often end up in foster care or homeless —  both of which are significantly correlated to academic underperformance. The children of incarcerated parents are also more likely to find themselves incarcerated eventually, repeating the cycle. Importantly, Morsy said, the report’s data takes socioeconomic and demographic characteristics into account that could be used to mitigate the findings —  including race, age, gender, parents’ educational attainment, and poverty status. “We reviewed studies across a number of different disciplines [like] epidemiology and sociology,” she said, adding that because the studies carefully control for factors that might contribute to poor outcomes “it suggests that it’s parental incarceration itself that’s the cause   …     and not the qualities of the children themselves or the children’s families. ”Interestingly, the report is heavily weighted toward incarcerated black fathers despite shifting gender trends in who is arrested and jailed. In totality, far more men than women are currently imprisoned. Yet a study released last August by the Vera Institute of Justice, a    think tank, showed the number of women in local jails —  the majority of them black or Hispanic, and nearly 80 percent of them mothers —  has grown   since 1970, representing the   U. S. correctional population. Additionally, an overwhelming majority of women (82 percent) are jailed for nonviolent offenses. Activists who work with incarcerated moms say the compelling and compounding harm when mothers are behind bars shouldn’t be overlooked. “The impact of incarcerated women, who are very often the sole caregiver for their children, is that those children are then displaced, and effectively punished through separation,” said Holly Krig, the director of organizing for Moms United Against Violence and Incarceration, an advocacy group in Chicago. Through her work, Krig has observed   how mothers are underrepresented and ignored in the discourse surrounding incarcerated parents, which is even reflected in the visits that parents receive. “Fathers report far more visits from their children when they are incarcerated than women do. The reason for that is because more often children continue to live with their mothers when their father is incarcerated   …     it’s the mother who ensures the kids continue to see their father. When moms are incarcerated, it’s far less often   …     the kids are more likely to be in the custody of either state foster care systems or with a grandmother or another relative [without] the resources. ”To address this disparity, Krig’s organization teamed up with local community leaders to raise funds for bus trips to reunite children and their mothers incarcerated at Logan Correctional Center, a women’s prison about three hours southwest of Chicago. Launched on Mother’s Day 2016, the monthly visits with rotating groups of children have been critical for youngsters and parents alike. Kids who reported the type of symptoms summarized in the EPI report —  difficulty in school, nightmares, and stress —  are experiencing some improvements. “We’ve been very intentional about creating a space in which we can talk about the underlying issues, where we can address feelings of shame people have around incarceration,” Krig said, emphasizing that the visits are “crucial for the survivability of whole families affected by incarceration, both the people who are incarcerated and [their children]. ”Combatting the negative impact of parental incarceration on children also fuels the work of Morsy, the EPI researcher and a former   teacher. Time spent in Bronx and East Harlem classrooms cemented the belief that social conditions of children outside school are inseparably connected to better performance inside school —  and “one of those social conditions [is] a fair   system. ”The report calls for educators to make   policy the focus of their advocacy at the local and state levels by teaming with   reformers to repeal mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses and nonviolent crimes, eliminate sentencing disparities, and increase support for released offenders. Morsy concedes that the recommendations are “a start, [not] a 100 percent solution, to our discriminatory justice system” but views them as a necessary and timely call to arms. “Educators advocate for and against charter schools   …     for and against pay for performance for teachers. I don’t see that it’s different to advocate for policies that would improve their students’ outcomes even if those policies are happening [outside] the education system,” she said, stressing that taking a stand to reform the criminal justice system is ultimately a     policy.

53363,73558,U.S. Ranks 23rd Out of 30 Developed Countries for Inequality,Atlantic,Gillian B. White,2017-01-16,2017.0,1.0,,"The United States is one of the richest countries in the world. It is also one of the most unequal. As a report released today shows, the U. S. ranks 23 out of 30 developed nations in a measure known as the “inclusive development index,” which factors in data on income, health, poverty, and sustainability. The index comes from the World Economic Forum, whose annual summit is taking place in Davos this week. It is a rather comprehensive measure of inequality, and the fact that the U. S. ranks so poorly is a sign of the country’s dramatic wealth concentration. Of all the factors in the index, the U. S. performed worst in what the WEF calls the inclusion category, which measures the distribution of income and wealth, and the level of poverty. Additionally, the country received particularly low marks in the areas of social protection —  defined as efficiency of public goods and services and robustness of social safety nets —  and employment and labor compensation.  The U. S. joins Brazil, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa as countries with   rankings that fall below their GDP per capita rankings, a sign that their economic growth is not being shared, the report says. The U. S. had the largest gap between the two measures. That economic inequality characterizes the American economy as no surprise. Study after study shows that America has more wealth concentration than most other developed nations. But WEF’s findings about how poorly the U. S. performs when it comes to wages and social safety nets is particularly notable since legislation intended to address those disparities are set to undergo significant changes in the early years of the Trump administration. In the U. S. wage growth has been   for much of the   era. That only changed this past year, when wages grew by around 2 percent. While that small bump is progress in the right direction, it is not enough to bring Americans financial security. The political parties are divided on why this is the case and what should be done about it.. Republicans tend to look at paltry wage gains and blame regulations that they say hinder business growth. That growth, they contend, would trickle down to workers’ paychecks. Additionally, as of late Republicans are also arguing that globalization has diminished the number of     jobs. The solutions many conservatives support include tightening trade and loosening regulations and taxes on American businesses. Democrats however, point to structural issues such as shareholder pressure on companies to produce stellar quarterly earnings, which often means boosting profits by cutting labor costs, or the decline in union power, which hinders the ability of workers to negotiate for higher salaries and better benefits. The answer, they generally argue, is to increase legislative protections for workers, including raising the minimum wage or strengthening   programs that provide for the very poor. The GOP will soon get its chance to test their ideas. As my colleagues Adam Chandler and Alexia Campbell have both written, perhaps the clearest indication of what the Trump administration has in mind for wage protections is the choice of Andrew Puzder for secretary of the Department of Labor. Puzder, the CEO of a   company, has been outspoken about his disdain for federally mandated   increases and new overtime rules that would result in either raises or additional pay for millions of workers. Conservatives have said that these rules place an undue burden on business owners, which could result in hiring fewer works, or giving them fewer hours —  which would ultimately hurt the labor force. Advocates of these federal initiatives say that, without them, workers —  especially   workers —  will remain underpaid, overworked, and without enough consistent income to access basic necessities. The WEF report argues that the U. S.’s striking inequality likely influences a variety of other disparities, including political and social polarization. The report suggests that while dangerous, the current problem can be improved through policies that, among other things, promote parity in wages regardless of gender, race or ethnicity educational opportunities and access to jobs.

53364,73559,These Pro-Lifers Are Headed to the Women’s March on Washington ,Atlantic,Emma Green,2017-01-16,2017.0,1.0,,"Updated on Monday, January 16 at 4:05 p. m.   women are headed to D. C. Yes, they’ll turn out for the annual March for Life, which is coming up on January 27. But one week earlier, as many as a few hundred   are planning to attend the Women’s March on Washington, which has been billed as feminist counterprogramming to the inauguration. With organizations like Planned Parenthood and NARAL   America   the event,   marchers have found themselves in a somewhat awkward position. What’s their place at an event that claims to speak for all women, but has aligned itself with   groups? With roughly a week to go before the march, organizers also released a set of “unity principles,” and one of them is “open access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control for all people. ” The Progressive Roots of the   Movement, Some   say they’ll protest. A delegation from Students for Life of America will be there to march against the influence of “the abortion industry” in the women’s movement, said Kristan Hawkins, the organization’s president. And Jeanne Mancini, the president of March for Life, said she was planning to attend but doesn’t know if she can now that the march’s policy platform includes support for abortion. But others are looking for solidarity. Many   women felt just as outraged as   women about Donald Trump’s conduct and comments, including the revelation that he once bragged about groping women without their permission. For their part, the organizers say   will be welcome to march on January 21st. A   group based in Texas, New Wave Feminists, was granted partnership status on Friday. “Intersectional feminism is the future of feminism and of this movement,” said Bob Bland, one of the event’s  . “We must not just talk about feminism as one issue, like access to reproductive care. ” (On Monday afternoon, after the publication of this article, the Women’s March organizers removed the New Wave Feminists from their website and list of partners. “The Women’s March’s platform is   and that has been our stance from day one,” the organizers said in a statement. “The   organization in question is not a partner of the Women’s March on Washington. We apologize for this error. ”) The   movement is changing. Many young activists identify as feminists or atheists and reject a uniform alignment with the Republican Party, unlike their Phyllis   predecessors. Perhaps the Women’s March on Washington is a sign that feminism is changing, too, ever so slightly: a first gathering of a truly “intersectional” movement which makes room for women with diverse convictions, including a moral opposition to abortion. Some of the   women going to the march are looking for solace in the wake of the election. “I was very concerned about the fact that in 2017, our presidential candidate was such a diehard misogynist,” said Destiny   La Rosa, the   president of a group called New Wave Feminists. “I get that he applied this   label, but I don’t know very many people who genuinely believe he’s  . ” While the organizers say the march is not an   protest, the fact that it’s happening the day after inauguration is not a coincidence. The stated purpose is broad —  to “send a bold message   …     that women’s rights are human rights” —  but Trump is clearly the context. In some ways, the march is not just about women it’s an affirmation of diversity. Bland gave a laundry list of groups whose voices will be at the center of the march, including people of color, those with disabilities, Muslims and “those of all diverse religious faiths,” undocumented immigrants, and LGBT folks. “They have been particularly targeted during the election cycle, and now, there’s a real concern that their rights will be stripped away,” Bland said. “We’re marching to say that we support them, and all women. ” Nothing about this mission is incompatible with a   viewpoint. In fact, some   would argue that their work is explicitly focused on promoting the dignity of all people, including folks who don’t fit a straight, white, conservative mold. A small group of marchers associated with the   publication Life Matters Journal will be there to support “this actual affirmation of peace and human rights, not just for women, but for all people of any or no gender, ethnicity, religion, immigration status, age, or disability,” said Rosemary Geraghty, a    University of Pittsburgh student who works as the publication’s the   coordinator. The only difference between her list and Bland’s is that hers includes “the  . ” Other   activists are attracted to the message of women’s empowerment, but they’re not interested in opposing the incoming president. “I’m not going to protest Trump’s presidency. It’s done. It’s over,” said Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood clinic director who started an organization to help     workers find jobs that line up with their views. “But I do think he needs women to hold him accountable. ” She listed workplace inequality, the pay gap, and women’s lack of access to health care as issues she wants to see highlighted under the next administration. “I’m just planning to go and join the march,” she said. “I have no desire to protest or anything like that. ” Catherine Glenn Foster, a D. C.  lawyer who also works as a senior fellow at the Charlotte Lozier Institute —  the research arm of the   advocacy group Susan B. Anthony List —  said she’s going neither to protest nor to stand in solidarity. “I would rather express that I’m committed to the march’s ideals and would hold all of us to a greater realization of those ideals of   for all,” she said. Some groups seem more interested in spinning up controversy than actually participating, though. Students for Life of America has invited hundreds of women to attend on Facebook, proclaiming that “we will not sit by as Planned Parenthood, our nation’s abortion Goliath and a sponsor of this march, betrays women into thinking abortion is their only choice. ” Hawkins, who served in the Bush administration before taking the top job in the   group, complained that Students for Life applied to be a partner in the march and never heard back, although they did receive an email encouraging all students to attend, she said. Bland said she was skeptical that any group would be rejected or ignored outright. The march has largely been put together by volunteers, many with little or no organizing experience, she said, and as a result, it’s been a little chaotic. Hawkins also objected to the     partners. The march originally had nothing to do with abortion, she said, but “they’ve allowed themselves to do is be bought out by big abortion. ” Some of the other   women who are going expressly disagreed with this combative attitude, though. “  it looks terrible that any   group would go out and protest women,”   La Rosa said. While the   I spoke with saw the   partnerships as a mistake, involving Planned Parenthood “was a   for us,” said Bland. Especially with a fight over the Affordable Care Act ahead, “one of the challenges facing women in this incoming administration is access to reproductive care,” she said. While   might object to the organization’s abortion services, 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood “offers are   services that are desperately needed by women all over this country. ” And yet, the march isn’t primarily about reproductive rights, Bland said, or even narrowly committed to one view on issues like abortion. “We’ve had some really interesting discussions with conservative folks and folks who identify as ” she said. While the organizers’ general position is that “a woman’s body is a woman’s body is a woman’s body,” she said, “I can’t tell you how many emails I received from women who identify as conservative who are marching with us on January 21 because there are so many other concerns. ” In all the emails they’ve gotten —  close to 1 million, Bland estimated —  women have expressed worries about cultural misogyny, the state of education and health care, and a desire for their own daughters to be able to lead. “There’s a lot more going on than one single issue,” she said. Staunchly   advocates might argue that there’s no room for   views in any women’s movement: “The ability to decide when or whether to have children is key to women’s opportunity to be financially secure and pursue their dreams,” wrote Planned Parenthood’s president, Cecile Richards, in an   for Time in 2015. But the   women who are attending the Women’s March on Washington are going to keep showing up. “I know people want to say we don’t exist, or we’re an oxymoron,”   La Rosa said. “But we do exist, and we are true feminists. We’re not just   who are also feminists. We’re feminists first and foremost. ” The Women’s March, in all its grassroots chaos, might be a feminist space where they’re actually welcome —  or, at least, where they can inconspicuously march along with everyone else. For her part, Bland said, she’ll be glad to see women of all backgrounds show up. “That’s what’s really powerful about this: It’s centering voices that have previously been either marginalized or silenced,” she said. “I’m so grateful to have this opportunity to walk together with my sisters and brothers. ”"
53365,73560,Flesh-Eating Worms Reach Florida’s Mainland  ,Atlantic,Sarah Zhang,2017-01-15,2017.0,1.0,,"The stray dog came with bad news. This week, the U. S. Department of Agriculture announced that a dog near Homestead, Florida —  a city 15 miles north of the Florida Keys —  was found with wounds infested with screwworms, the much dreaded   pest. If you’re not familiar with screwworm, it’s because the U. S. poured millions of dollars into eradicating them back in 1982. But last fall, it reemerged in the Florida Keys, catching almost everyone by surprise. Wildlife biologists eventually found several deer on the archipelago with the parasite. Screwworms lay eggs in open wounds, burrowing into the flesh of pets and occasionally even humans. Livestock, historically, was the big economic concern. Florida still sends hundreds thousands of young calves to herds around the country each year, so a screwworm infestation could do some real damage. “The screwworm is a potentially devastating animal disease that sends shivers down every rancher’s spine,” said Florida’s Commission of Agriculture Adam Putnam, in a statement that accompanied the official declaration of agricultural emergency last October. The Keys infestation was bad, but at least it was somewhat isolated on the archipelago. Officials set up an animal health checkpoint at mile 106 on U. S. Highway 1, the main road that leads from the mainland to the Keys. The checkpoint would scan animals leaving the Keys —  usually pets traveling with their owners —  for infestation with screwworm. It’s not clear exactly how that stray dog got infested or where it had been before it was found in Homestead. The USDA heard about the animal from a vet in the area. It has since be treated. “It’s a very treatable condition if caught early,” says USDA veterinary medical officer Robert Dickens. “The dog is doing really well. ” Individual animals can get   drugs. But the best   weapon against screwworms are sterile screwworms, deliberately sterilized using   in a factory. Release enough of them and they will prevent any of the   ones from finding a mate. This was the strategy that eradicated screwworms from the U. S. 30 years ago, and this is the strategy USDA has been using to get screwworms out of the Keys again. The USDA has released 80 million sterile screwworms across 25 sites in the Keys, and now will add Homestead to the list of release sites. On Friday, state and federal teams released sterile screwworms at Homestead, and they will continue doing so twice a week for the next six to nine weeks.   Worms Have Returned to Florida, It’s still unclear where the screwworms came from. After the U. S. eradicated the pests, it partnered with countries in South and Central America, releasing sterile screwworms further and further south until they reached one of the narrowest parts of the continent, the Darien Gap in Panama. Here, millions of sterile screwworms are still dumped by the   to form an invisible but permanent sterile insect barrier. Perhaps someone or something brought it to the Keys from further south. Perhaps it came from Cuba, Haiti, or the Dominican Republican, which have not eradicated screwworms and are just short expanse of ocean away. Wherever it came from, it eventually reached a stray dog in Florida."
53366,73561,Why More Writers Should Talk About Money ,Atlantic,Joseph Frankel ,2017-01-15,2017.0,1.0,,"Money makes people anxious —  perhaps even more so with writers. The relationship between commerce and writing is commonly sketched out in caricatures: the starving artist, the hapless student, the privileged few who “make it. ” More often, it’s not addressed at all. In the past few years, some writers have begun to more openly approach questions of class. The internet has seen a profusion of such pieces: A writer who is “sponsored” by her husband calls on other writers to be more transparent about where their money comes from. Another outlines the clear advantages that being born rich, connected, and able to attend expensive schools furnishes to becoming a successful writer. In another case, a woman who wrote a   debut novel details how she went broke after a single advance. A new book of essays and interviews with writers on the topic of money, released earlier this month, aims to dig even deeper. Scratch: Writers, Money, and the Art of Making a Living, edited by Manjula Martin, includes hard truths and thoughtful meditations on class and capitalism while also functioning as a survival guide. In one essay, Roxane Gay (Bad Feminist, Difficult Women) speaks frankly about her student debt, annual income, and past day jobs. In another, Martin herself explains the kind of   by which writers conceal their class background in talking about their careers. By turns comforting, depressing, and illuminating, Scratch paints a fuller, more personal picture of what it’s like to make a living from —  or while —  writing. I spoke with Martin about the intersection of writing, money, and class, as well as the process of making Scratch. This conversation has been edited and condensed. Joseph Frankel : Some of the writers you spoke with for Scratch were very frank about their finances and their class backgrounds. Others were a little more reluctant. What accounts for these different levels of openness? Manjula Martin: In my experience working with writers on this topic, it’s often the people who have more money who don’t want to talk about money. Transparency is a really scary thing for a lot of people in any profession, and I think there are good reasons for that. But people who are excited to talk about the topic, even if they’re nervous, inherently understand . .. that it takes transparency to change stuff. It’s the old saw of “knowledge is power,” and I think that extends to writers and money. There are a lot of barriers to access for people who come from   backgrounds, or maybe less traditional educational backgrounds, or who have had to deal with other types of prejudices in their life. If we want that to change, we need to start being honest about how this business actually works. Frankel: Essays in the collection call attention to the creative value of day jobs and, in the case of Leslie Jamison (The Empathy Exams) their impact on writers’ output. Others, particularly the piece by Alexander Chee (The Queen of the Night, Edinburgh) think that the discussion of day jobs helps to romanticize unfair pay for writers. How do you think about the relationship between other kinds of work and writing?   Martin: I think that some of the stuff Chee says in his essay is particularly valuable for younger writers who maybe haven’t been around in an era where folks were ever really compensated well. I’ve certainly written for free. I’d bet Chee has done it too, and I think he talks about that in his essay. But if you’re hiring me to do work, you need to pay me, is sort of his stance. And I agree with that 100 percent.   You mentioned romanticizing that relationship between work and craft. I think it’s very tricky because there is a lot of dangerous romanticization, and that can set writers up, particularly in the beginnings of their careers, to blunder in a business they know nothing about. Chee has a great quote in his essay where he talks about how any education in writing should include an education in how to make a living as a writer. There is a place for the romantic in the writer’s life, but there’s a difference between romance and being ignorant. Gay says that really nicely in her interview where she’s just like, “I don’t want to kill the dream of my students by being like, ‘it’s really hard to make a living! ’” But it’s also the responsibility of older generations of writers to let folks know really what it’s like. It drives me equally crazy to read advice to writers on the internet that’s like, “Here’s how to write a bestseller in 7 steps” or “You are guaranteed to get a book deal. ” I think that’s the flipside of the same coin. Frankel: Going back to Chee, he recalls looking at the lives of his writing mentors —  tenured academics and literary magazine writers —  as models for his career. These models, he writes, have now become less attainable. How do you think the financial prospects of writing have changed over time, or affected the voices that get to be heard? Martin: I think anyone who is alive and of working age in even the 1990s has experienced in their lifetimes —  and I’m including myself in this —  a decline in the ability to make a living as a writer, whether you’re writing books or working as a journalist. Chee and I are around the same age, and I also worked in magazines in New York in the 1990s, and that part of his essay rang very true to me. There were people who were definitely making $2 or $3 a word to write profiles in GQ. And you can still write profiles for GQ, but it’s been 20 years and that rate has not gone up. If anything, it’s gone down. Particularly when it comes to journalism, that is a measurable truth. In the book industry, it’s a little harder to measure because the industry is so wacky about advances. But I do think that as it becomes more difficult to make a living as a writer, a narrower selection of voices are being heard. And that means a more limited pool of stories are being told. As we’re moving into an era where the freedom of press is going to be severely restricted if not entirely threatened, I think that question becomes even more urgent. Frankel: In your essay on your own writing and working life, you say, “It’s presumed my story is authentic when I speak about work and art and say I was once a seamstress. ” You then introduce the idea of “writerly  ” —  a way writers with a degree of class privilege reshape their stories about their own “day job struggles. ” What shapes the way writers talk about their “struggles,” or relative lack thereof? Martin: Everybody has a story they tell about themselves to themselves, and then everyone has a version of that story they tell to the world. I don’t think writers are all that different —  I think everybody does this. Maybe people don’t articulate it as well if they’re not people whose work it is to articulate things. What I was doing in that essay was to really call bullshit on my own story. I have this narrative of myself as a scrappy college dropout who made it, when in reality, my parents work in a university and have my whole childhood. I was   growing up. I was definitely very poor for many years, but that was a poverty of choice. Cheryl Strayed (Tiny Beautiful Things, Wild) talks about this in her interview: She is a very educated person, and so she has chosen to go into debt in order to do her art and make her work. But she grew up very, very poor, as in like    poor, and so she’s very attuned to that difference. I think it’s crucial for writers who are talking about their struggles with money to be rigorous in examining their own narratives, and making sure that their narratives reflect reality. The legend of the “starving artist,” I think, on one hand can be very true, because we have always lived in a society and an economy that doesn’t value the arts monetarily in the same way that it values other things. On the other hand, let’s dig a little deeper than that, and if you’re not actually starving let’s talk about that. Frankel: Jamison argues that all art is shaped by outside forces, including money and the institutions that have it. How do you think the influence of these forces like universities and publishing houses plays out in the kinds of writing that see an audience? Martin: I think [those forces] entirely shape what gets seen. These multiple influences that Jamison talks so brilliantly about —  money, institutions, the influence of other artists, your community or your cohort —  are huge. It’s interesting because I think Jamison is arguing that rather than institutions destroying the integrity of work, they are actually what makes up the work, and I think that’s true to a certain extent. Frankel: Daniel José Older (Shadowshaper, the Bone Street Rumba series) writes that the language of economics —  what “The Market” demands —  is used to obscure barriers that are in place for writers of color in publishing. Are there other ways the language of economics covers up the obstacles writers face? Martin: The language of “quality” and “merit” also gets used to obscure things. There’s an idea by publishers and editors that “we only choose the ‘best’ stories to publish. That’s our only rubric. We’re looking at stories in a ‘pure’ way. And only judge them on their value. ” That’s just not how humans work, and if you’re a person whose job it is to edit or publish, you have tastes and feelings and opinions, and that goes into what you’re choosing. Otherwise it would be boring. But I think that relying on the language of merit doesn’t acknowledge the types of barriers —  the racism, the sexism, the economic privilege —  that are inherent in our culture and our society and, obviously, also in publishing. And in fact there are studies that publishing is some crazy percentage white, right? (Editor: A study from January 2016 found that the publishing industry as a whole was 79 percent white.) That doesn’t happen because only white people write good books. Frankel: A lot of writers in this collection, including Jamison and Strayed, seem to be making a call for financial transparency from individual writers. How do you think that greater openness can shape the way people perceive writing as a career? Martin: The only people who benefit from nobody in an industry knowing what each other makes are the people at the very top, the people signing the paychecks. The people getting the paychecks never benefit from that. It’s my hope that this kind of open conversation can have an empowering effect both on writers and people who want to be writers. While it can be scary to confront   “real talk” about money, it’s essential. And it could hopefully allow writers to have greater control of the economics of our business. The whole thing with Scratch is writers are a part of the world, which means that we are part of the economy. And this project is the product of my belief that we can be better at our jobs, and also better at our lives and have better jobs and have better lives if we acknowledge that we live in the world like everyone else. Frankel: What should younger or aspiring writers take away from Scratch? Martin: If this book can help people understand what it is actually like to be a working writer, it’s done its job. There’s so much speculation, vagueness, and mystery around that, that just that existing on paper is important. When I told people about this project, overwhelmingly, they would say “Oh, good, it’s not just me who’s obsessed with this stuff. ” A lot of people are curious about this. Money is intricately entwined with the type of work we do. We don’t have to like it, we maybe don’t even have to be good at the money side, but we have to acknowledge it and know that that’s okay."
53367,73562,Americans Can Soon Buy Groceries Online With Food Stamps,Atlantic,Adam Chandler,2017-01-15,2017.0,1.0,,"Last week, the U. S. Department of Agriculture announced an   pilot program that will give participants in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) —  best known by the colloquial term “food stamps” —  a way to purchase their groceries online. The   trial, which will begin this summer, provides   Americans in seven states with a system to have eligible items delivered to their homes through retailers like FreshDirect, Amazon, Safeway, and ShopRite and to pay for them using federal benefits. ”Online purchasing is a potential lifeline for SNAP participants living in urban neighborhoods and rural communities where access to healthy food choices can be limited,” said USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement. The initiative is actually a provision of the 2014 Farm Bill, which requires the USDA to test an online ordering program. If the pilot succeeds, it could expand nationally, which would theoretically provide more than 43 million Americans who receive SNAP assistance with a new way to access healthier food. But despite its clear benefits, particularly for those with disabilities, limited transportation, or the millions of   Americans in food deserts, the success of the program is anything but certain. A number of factors including existing consumer habits, associated costs, and internet access could dim the prospects for the idea, while external opposition from lobbyists could potentially could block its   adoption. In addition to good publicity, part of what lured seven retailers from Maryland to Iowa to Oregon to apply to participate in the USDA program was the chance to expand their customer bases, and increase revenue. Companies from Amazon down to   —   an   grocery —   will collect delivery and service fees from these new transactions, fees that cannot be paid for with federal benefits. The retail partners also offer a host of food items that are not eligible for SNAP funds. What this may ultimately beget is a dynamic in which the convenience of the pilot program is overshadowed by the extra costs and logistical complications associated with delivery, along with the need for multiple forms of payment SNAP users will need to complete an order. Another challenge facing the program is the demographic overlap between SNAP recipients and Americans without internet access. A recent 2016 Pew survey shows that those most likely to  lack regular access to the internet are   minorities, particularly skewing younger and older. According to federal data, SNAP recipients —  relative to the American population —  break down along similar demographic lines, with over half of federal benefits given to children and seniors. Meanwhile, roughly 20 percent of Americans are primarily dependent on their smartphones for internet access, which could hamper the ability to navigate a complex online ordering system. Yet another hurdle may be geographic. While many tend to associate federal food assistance with urban poverty, the use of food stamps in rural communities has been growing steadily in recent years. As Rachel Cernansky at Civil Eats noted in 2014, enrollment among Americans eligible for SNAP was 13 percent higher in rural areas than in urban ones. This disparity no doubt affects how and particularly where SNAP benefits are spent according to the Omaha   “Slightly more than half of all SNAP dollars are spent at superstores like Walmart, which is not part of the pilot program. ” And aside from the logistical challenges, once unveiled, the SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot seems poised to face political opposition from associations representing    stores —  who fear the program will cut into their margins. Following the reveal of the states participating in the pilot program, local retailers that might be affected quickly condemned the USDA initiative. ”With supermarkets disappearing from neighborhoods in all five boroughs, this pilot program will only accelerate the trend,” New York Association of Grocery Stores spokesman Brad Gerstman said in a statement. Meanwhile, in Annapolis, Cailey Locklair Tolle, the head of the Maryland Retailers Association, told the Baltimore Sun that she had received several calls from businesses about the program. “Any time you tinker with any part of the revenue for a grocery store, you can literally send them in the red very quickly,” she said. Despite these obstacles, the biggest challenge to the pilot program may come from the intended participants, whose habits may be difficult to change. A 2012 RAND study shed some light on the preconception that access to healthier food, particularly fruits and vegetables, materially translates into better diets. The study found limited compelling links between food environment and food consumption, meaning that the easier availability of quality foods may not trump consumer preferences for junk. And as I noted last month, large food companies have also sought to step into this breach, offering more products with less fat and sodium, only to find that they sell poorly. Online, people are still likely to want what they’ve always wanted."
53368,73563,Seeking an Escape From Trump’s America,Atlantic,Emma Green,2017-01-15,2017.0,1.0,,"VIRGINIA —   For the last eight years, Nicolas and Rachel Sarah have been slowly weaning themselves off fossil fuels. They don’t own a refrigerator or a car their   baby and    toddler play by candlelight rather than electricity at night. They identify as Christian anarchists, and have given an official name to their search for an alternative to   American life: the Downstream Project, with the motto to “do unto those downstream as you would have those upstream do unto you. ” As it turns out, exiting the system is a challenging,   and surprisingly technical process. Here in the Shenandoahs and central Virginia, a handful of tiny communities are experimenting with what it means to reject the norms of contemporary life and exist in a radically different way. They seem to share Americans’ pervasive sense of political alienation, which arguably reached an apotheosis with the election of Donald Trump: a sense of division from their peers, a distrust of government. The challenges of modern politics —  dealing with issues like climate change, poverty, mass migration, and war on a global scale —  are so vast and abstract that it’s difficult not to find them overwhelming. But instead of continuing in passive despair, as many Americans seem to do, the people in these communities decided to overhaul their lives. These communities show just how hard it is to live without fossil fuels, a government safety net, or a system of capitalist exchange. They struggle with many of the same issues that plague the rest of America, including health problems, financial worries, and racism. At the center of their political lives is a question that every American faces, but for them, it’s amplified: whether to save the world or let it burn. Their answers are different, but they share one thing. They’ve seen what modern American life looks like. And they want out. * * * Communities like this have a lot of names, including homesteads, intentional communities, or   communities, which is really a way of saying “commune. ” Louisa County, Virginia, is home to five such communities: Twin Oaks, founded in 1967, and its later   Acorn and Sapling, along with two fairly new communities, the Living Energy Farm and Cambia. Taken together with the Downstream Project, which is located an hour or two away in Harrisonburg, these newer communities offer three rough models for what it means to create an alternative lifestyle in response to immense global challenges: to struggle at the edges of society, to remake it, or to build a haven for retreat. A Radical Idea: Four   Share All Their Money, Unlike the rural communities of Louisa, Nicolas and Rachel Sarah explicitly wanted to build the Downstream Project in an urban context. (Nicolas and Rachel Sarah each have slightly different last names, in keeping with the Latin American tradition of Nicolas’s family. Their first names are used here for clarity.) Rather than rejecting mainstream culture entirely and living in the woods, they’re struggling to live as ethically as possible in the city, with a particular focus on environmental sustainability and energy use. But their approach —  engaging and educating, rather than retreating —  makes them particularly vulnerable to the challenges and risks of urban life. The two    dream of buying land within a   distance of the city so they can supply their homestead with fresh food, but have found the real estate prohibitively expensive. Harrisonburg has only a modest bus system, so it’s difficult to get around. They’ve had trouble recruiting people to join   their project has mostly been attractive to transient,   interns, several of whom have lived with them. “What we’ve discovered in a big way is that you can’t do this by yourself, even in a city,” said Rachel Sarah. “And you can’t homestead by yourself if you have a family even more. ” Perhaps worst of all, Nicolas recently injured his arm, which “flavored our whole year,” Rachel Sarah said. He had been planning to develop ways to make their own food and medicine. Instead, they had to pay for those things, along with medical bills because they’re uninsured, they’ve had to get financial assistance from hospitals and medical centers. In recent months, they’ve made small but meaningful concessions, like using a crockpot to make dinners. As they’ve built their project, they have also found themselves caught between two worlds. “Among people who are wanting to live the same lifestyle —  being   free —  there is a lot of push against Christianity,” Rachel Sarah said. “It’s almost like anything is okay except Christianity, because that’s oppressive. ” The opposite is true at church: While some in their Mennonite congregation are open to what they’re doing, she said, they’ve found little willingness among their fellow Christians to lift up climate change or the environment as theological issues. To them, though, the case for creating environmentally conscious communities is evident in the Bible. “The story of the Jews was that they are emancipated, tribal slaves [who] went out and tried to start their own society,” Nicolas said. “Anarchism is in the story: Simple,   organization of societies, not huge, hierarchical systems. ” They’re hopeful that Trump’s election will spur more people to think critically about their lives. “Times like this really awaken people,” said Rachel Sarah. “Since [the election] we’ve started to feel really hopeful. ” Trump’s election left Nicolas feeling sick to his stomach, he said, but he sees an upside. “When there’s a Democrat in power,    people go to sleep, because they feel validated by what they hear on NPR,” he said. The couple says they’re feeling more “awake” now, too. Trump’s election is “like a crescendo for the Christian anarchist call,” Nicolas said. “If we are citizens of another kingdom, and the empire is getting pretty ridiculous, it inspires us to take our convictions more seriously. ” * * * The folks at the Living Energy Farm are not as confident that their fellow Americans are ready to take their failures seriously. “Among the people I hang out with, there’s a fair amount of alienation from both the political right and the political left,” said Alexis Zeigler, who   the community with his wife, Debbie Piesen. “We are not trying to change who is in office. You can’t dictate a democratic society from the top. You really have to build it from the bottom up. ” The Living Energy Farm runs on a different philosophy of alienation: If they can prototype alternatives to modern life, they believe, they can eventually remake the world. The community is located half a mile up a dirt road in Louisa County, which gave 60 percent of its vote to Trump in November Charlottesville and Richmond are each 40 minutes to an hour away by car. Two couples and four kids live there permanently, along with a   electrician, Eddie, who has been there about seven months, and a regular cycle of interns and travelers. They’re farther off the grid than the Downstream Project: They function entirely without fossil fuels, and their home and   business are powered by a suite of firewood, motors, solar collectors, and other devices explicitly designed to be inexpensive and simple to implement. In the summer, they cook with a small solar dish and a rocket stove behind the kitchen they’re building a bigger dish, taller than a grown man, nearby. They hooked up an exercise bike to a washing machine and rigged a pair of old tractors to run on wood gas rather than gasoline, although they aren’t quite functional. They built their own   room off the kitchen, where they process vegetables grown on their 127 acres, and they graft   branches onto wild stems. “We refer to it as   or Amish without the patriarchy,” Zeigler said. They’re not religious their goal is evangelization of a different kind. “My intent is to get Living Energy Farm on its feet and try to convince people to live this way,” Zeigler said. Recently, they’ve been experimenting on their interns’ cellphones to develop   chargers, which he hopes could be used in India or Africa. “The way we choose to live has far more impact in terms of our environment   …     than any particular technology,” he said. “If Americans bother to talk about the environment at all, it’s usually in terms of a technological perspective. ” He thinks mainstream environmentalism is too focused on incremental reform and modest lifestyle choices, like driving Priuses. “For us, the question is: How do I live comfortably with what renewable energy can do?   …     If you ask it that way, you can’t drive to D. C. and work in a cubicle,” he said. “But the environmental groups want to tell you that you can, because then you’ll send them donations. ” The Living Energy Farm residents seem less invested in critiquing government than capitalism. “We don’t buy gasoline, and we don’t pay anybody bills for energy,” Zeigler said. “It’s not coincidental that this frees us from corporate dependence. ” For his part, Zeigler doesn’t think government is inherently bad, and doesn’t identify as an anarchist. (“The problem with anarchism is not that the theory, in its ideal sense, is broken. It’s that a lot of nitwits use that word,” he said.) The idea underlying the Living Energy Farm is that people can change the structure of society by changing the way they live. Without sprawling cities and   homes, powered by expensive electricity and   cars, there will be no need for   solutions like the Paris Climate Agreement. Their view is at least partly premised on apocalypse —  “industrialism is going to collapse,” Zeigler said,    —  and their work is meant to address that eventuality. “Can we build a mass movement tomorrow? No, and I’m not even worried about it,” Zeigler said. But “can we do that before we turn the planet into Easter Island?” But even within such idealistic communities, not everyone sees the goal as engagement. Deanna Seay, one of the other Living Energy Farm residents, moved there last June with her two kids and husband, Misha Nikitine. He was interested in the politics, but she was mostly looking for an affordable way to live. “I envisioned being remote, being able to keep to ourselves, not being involved in whatever strife is going on in cities,” she said. She was glad to leave behind Boston and demonstrations like the ones that took place after Trump’s election she’s also glad they now drink from a well, she said, because “it feels safer to be in a place where we have control over our water. ” Hers is not a search for ideals, but for something tolerable —  something better than what was available elsewhere. At Cambia, another, unrelated community in Louisa County, some of the members seem to have a similar impulse. A   couple, Ella Sutherland and Gil Benmoshe, started the community with their son Avni about a year and a half ago. Two others —  Anthony Beck, who go by the names Telos, and another man called Gilgamesh —  live with them in their small house and nearby cabin they’re building a barn out back, and they’ve laid plots along a path through the woods where they’re hoping to construct more dwellings. Altogether, they’re looking for 10 or 12 people to join them. Cambians share their income, and their goal is to “create an alternative to mainstream or capitalist society,” they said. They fund their community in part through a small woodworking shop, where they make wooden spoons. They have a car, and get about a third of their food from   dumpsters —  they’re “freegans,” Sutherland said, meaning they only eat meat and dairy if it’s going to be thrown away. While the Cambians are dismayed by the election, it has mostly strengthened their conviction that they shouldn’t be involved in politics. “I’m embarrassed to say that I felt like I had to vote,” Benmoshe said. “I don’t believe in democracy, so I should have abstained. But I felt like it was really critical.   …     Well, that didn’t do any good. ” Even though they believe many people are unhappy within the current political and economic systems, they don’t feel particularly called to engage in politics because of Trump. “There are a lot of people who feel isolated, who feel violated by capitalism in various different ways,” Sutherland said. “We should be creating an alternative, and that’s needed now more than it was needed before. ” Instead, most of their energy is directed at building their home —  literally. They follow practices called “natural building,” using materials like cob (a combination of clay, sand, and straw) to line their walls, and   energy sources for heat. Their backyard is full of spare parts and fixtures, including a random sink and lots of wood their free time is often spent on construction projects. To some extent, they’re trying to spread their knowledge and their project. They’re writing a wiki, nicknamed “commune in a box,” outlining legal and tax details for   communities —  Cambia, it turns out, is both a commune and an LLC. They want people to be able to start new communities, tailored to their own needs Cambia is not the model, they said, but a model. That model, though, largely doesn’t involve politics. “I really should be working on a campaign to change the political structure of this world. Instead, I’m working in natural building,” Benmoshe said. “I don’t want to be an activist anymore.   …     It requires me to rub against the things that I hate too much, and I get sad and frustrated. ” Cambia was not built to usher in a revolution. It was built as a refuge. * * * Intentional communities are, in their own way, historical projects. The original “cities of refuge,” found in the Bible, were havens for people who had committed heinous crimes. In early modern Europe, religious separatists transformed this idea, establishing towns where they could await the imminent coming of Christ, writes the Williams College art historian Michael J. Lewis in his book, City of Refuge. Great thinkers have long told of socialist paradises and philosophers have pondered distant, lost societies. In all of these communities, historic and   utopian dreamers face the same question: Are they willing to engage at all in politics as they are, or do they wish to build the world anew? Ironically, the deeply secular Cambia comes closest to those older models of religious separatism that Lewis chronicles in City of Refuge. The historic groups that most eagerly sought to escape the world were obsessed with building geometrically pleasing, architecturally   towns —  physical manifestations of their deeply held values. There, in their isolated hamlets, they could experiment freely with social orders and norms, safely separate from the world. Perhaps it’s unfair to look to penalize utopias for failing to offer salvation. After all, people who live in these kinds of communities tend to be more politically active than the average American, said Karen Litfin, a professor of political science at the University of Washington who has written about   around the world. And perhaps these communities are not as immune from worldly flaws as they might like. For example: Many of them struggle to be accessible to people other than   white folks. Sky Blue, a Twin Oaks resident who also serves as the executive director of the Fellowship for Intentional Community, said there are “a lot of racial [problems] and racism that are embedded in intentional communities. ” Even despite good intentions, “Liberal white people who have a desire for diversity don’t necessarily understand what it means to be inclusive,” he said. “They’re going to create culture in [their] intentional community that is going to be comfortable for them, which isn’t necessarily comfortable for people of color, or people with disabilities, or people who are gay or trans. ” Ethan Tupelo, a doctoral candidate at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who lived at Twin Oaks before he began studying intentional communities academically, said residents talked about this issue a lot when he was there. “It’s a bunch of white people sitting around wondering where all the people of color are,” he said. “It’s nice that you’re thinking about that, but it’s also frustrating. ” Tupelo sees a structural explanation for the inaccessibility of intentional communities: It takes a lot of cash to get off the grid. “Even when starting a new community, you need the capital to do it in the first place if you want it to be a legally recognized thing, as opposed to squats,” he said. As Nicolas and Rachel Sarah’s experience at the Downstream Project shows, becoming untangled from capitalism also means becoming much more vulnerable. It’s tough to imagine a comprehensive way of replacing health insurance, not to mention programs like welfare, in a world without government. And then there is the tension between engagement and escape. In parts of the environmental movement, of which many intentional communities would consider themselves participants, the impulse toward escape can be powerful, and dark. In a 2012 essay for Orion magazine —  a piece Nicolas specifically recommended —  the writer Paul Kingsnorth argued that one of the things   people should do at this moment in history is build havens. “Can you think, or act, like the librarian of a monastery through the Dark Ages, guarding the old books as empires rise and fall outside?” he wrote. Litfin said she doesn’t think it’s possible for humanity to go back to medieval times, no matter how tempting that may be for some. “In the Dark Ages, they didn’t have the internet. They didn’t have global travel. They didn’t have climate change to any great extent,” she said. “What we have now is an embryonic global civilization that’s totally ecologically, socially, and economically unsustainable.   …     There’s no escaping into your own little enclave. ” Some people use the term “lifestyle politics” to describe these communities —  “the belief that if you live your values, then you will be able to make effective change, or at least express your political perspective,” Litfin said. “I think that’s a good place to start, but if that’s where you end, you actually don’t have much impact at all. ” In their own way, each of these communities is trying to change the world, albeit in small ways. Not everyone who seeks utopia is like Zeigler at the Living Energy Project, though. People don’t necessarily want to remake the world. “The one thing everybody knows about utopia is that it means ‘no place,’” Lewis writes. What’s less   he says, is that the Greek word for “utopia” sounds the same as “eutopia,” a word with a different meaning: “good place. ” For all their struggles, this seems to capture the aspirations of Virginia’s   utopias. “We’re just these little workers building this giant cathedral,” said Nicolas. “Each of us is just chipping away at a little block. We don’t even have the   cathedral. But we’re doing a little block. ” In the face of increasingly alienating politics and massive global   perhaps this is enough: building a good place, better than most, where people can try to live."
53369,73564,Will Mike Pence Be Trump’s Bridge to Democrats?,Atlantic,Alex Wagner,2017-01-15,2017.0,1.0,,"Though he has not yet been installed in the Oval Office, Donald Trump has already made life fairly complex for his Republican brethren in Congress. Most recently, in an interview with the New York Times this week, Trump singlehandedly threw the GOP’s Obamacare repeal process into chaos, insisting that a repeal vote would come “probably some time next week” and a replacement “very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter. ” Neither was correct, but especially the replacement timeline: Congressional Republicans  are quietly insisting that it will be weeks before a replacement bill is ready —  maybe even months (or years! ).   Seeking an Escape Hatch From Trump’s America, The only person in the administration who seemed willing to acknowledge this reality is Vice   Mike Pence.  In a press conference earlier this month, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers, Pence said: “The architecture of the replacement of Obamacare will come together, as it should, through the legislative process in the weeks and months ahead. ” To be clear, Pence’s comments regarding the replacement timeline were made before his boss announced the “very quickly, very shortly thereafter” timeline for repeal. But Pence is a former congressman himself and knows well the realities of passing legislation —  especially in the case of Obamacare, where a replacement program will require 60 votes. In other words, Democrats will need to be part of the solution. The question is: can Mike Pence mitigate the situation —  bring his boss down to earth, and maybe even help with outreach to the opposition party? While Trump has made a point of sharing his excitements and proclivities to an almost pornographic degree —  it’s nearly impossible not to know what Trump’s opinion is on everything from Vanity Fair subscriptions to Meryl Streep to the latest season of The Apprentice —  Pence, constitutionally, remains more of a cipher. Pence no doubt favors conservative policy: his opposition to gay rights and reproductive health services are well documented, his distaste for social welfare programs equally so. But as it concerns his temperament, his negotiating style, his leadership acumen, it’s hard to know what kind of man Pence is, other than a relatively quiet one. Given Trump’s inclination towards hostility, Pence maybe the minority party’s best hope of breaking through to the White House —  just as Biden before him, Pence may be able to speak to adversaries in Congress more effectively than the president himself. In this, it’s most useful, perhaps, to ask those who have worked with him. As my colleague Yoni Appelbaum reported at the GOP convention this summer, Indiana Republicans have only glowing assessments of the former leader: “The single most important thing is how good a guy he is,” said one GOP state representative. But what of Indiana democrats —  faced with an uphill climb in a state legislature dominated by republicans? Congressional democrats will find themselves in a similar position, though in a narrower minority, and might use some guidance from those who have negotiated with Pence before. State Representative Terry Goodin, of the state’s 66th House District, was the most diplomatic of the democrats I spoke with. Goodin says he’s known the former governor for four or five years and conceded that he was “a little more proactive” with Pence than most in his party. “Even being in the minority, I’ve had more personal dealings with him,” he said, concluding nonetheless that, “the governor stands firm for some of those things he believes in. ” The best way to get an issue resolved, he advised, was to appeal to Pence’s sense of bipartisanship. “That makes it a little tastier,” said Goodin. I asked him about that appeal and how best to make it. “No different than the way you’d deal with anyone else,” said Goodin. “He’s the kind of person who is not reactive to a loud voice or a scream. Be courteous. ” This all seemed eminently   if not necessarily characteristic of the Trump administration thus far: a focus on bipartisanship, courtesy and indoor voices. But then I spoke with former Indiana Democratic Party chair Ann DeLaney, who has known Pence since his Congressional campaign in 1990. “What’s he like?” she said. “One, he’s quite personable. Two, he’s not aloof. Three, he’s easy to talk to. ” But she continued: “He doesn’t always think through the impact of what his positions will be. ” DeLaney cited Pence’s foray into the hornet’s nest over the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RIFRA) which was signed into law by Pence amid national outcry. “That was not only a PR disaster —  and permitted discrimination —   but he signed it into law as we were having the Final Four here,” Delaney recounted. “The media from all over country was here —  it got a tremendous amount of play that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. ” Pence, she said was completely caught off guard. DeLaney does not appear think particularly highly of Pence’s management skills. “He ran the governor’s office 9 to 5,” she said. “That’s hard to do. Crises don’t always occur between 9 to 5. I don’t think you can be an active Vice President and keep to that schedule. ” For Democrats eager to use Pence as a backchannel to either the administration, (in the hopes that he might take their case to the president) or his own party (in the hopes that he might broker some bipartisanship) DeLaney was fairly grim. “He’s pretty firmly an ideologue. He’ll do what he’s told,” she said. As it pertained to bringing his boss back to reality, Representative Charlie Brown, from Indiana’s 3rd House District, was not optimistic. When Pence was in the governor’s office, said Brown, “he did not want to rock the boat. ” “He doesn’t lay down the law,” added DeLaney. “He’s just not strong enough. ” Brown went further, saying that Pence had a hard time corralling even his own party, back in Indiana. “He had some tough times with his own caucus in both chambers,” said Brown. “They had a super majority and they wanted to appear to be united. ” But, he said,   problems arose, “Mainly because [Pence] put religion first. That whole debacle over RIFRA is what sunk him. They had a tiger by the tail. Those are his beliefs and you can’t take that away from him. It created havoc with business community. ” Still, members of the minority party might at least expect a less confrontational tone from the veep’s office, especially compared to what may be issuing forth from the man in the Oval Office (or his Twitter account). “He will not want confrontation on an individual level,  ” said DeLaney. “He’ll be much more ‘in sorrow than in anger.’ He’ll wring his hands, say [to democrats] I just can’t bring [the rest of my party] along —  so you’re going to have to do this. ” And according to Goodin, Pence’s decisions are usually final: “After he makes a decision, he doesn’t entertain much else. ” Ultimately, said DeLaney, Pence may not be all that constitutionally suited for the hurly burly of the Trump administration —  which, if the recent past is any indication, is likely to be a unpredictable and tumultuous ride. “He impresses me as someone who can deliver a message, speak well, hold his own in front of the mic,” she said, “but he’s much more comfortable with problems and solutions on index cards. And some of those problems and solutions don’t fit so well on index cards. ”"
53370,73565,How Cash Bail Keeps the Poor in Jail,Atlantic,Anne Kim,2017-01-15,2017.0,1.0,,"“All out of the blue a bunch of police cars pulled up and grabbed me,” Shaw told me in September. “They threw me to the wall and put cuffs on me. ” The officers insisted he had come out of the house, which Shaw just as vehemently denied. “They thought I was someone else,” he said. “That’s what they thought the whole time. They called a name out that wasn’t me. ” Shaw is a tall, heavyset,    black man with a booming voice and an easy smile. He told his story almost cheerfully, emphasizing the absurdity of the harrowing situation he was describing. Over his protests, Shaw continued, the police dragged him into the house, where a woman inside told the officers she had no idea who he was. The officers pushed him onto a couch and went through his pockets, finding the keys to his mother’s car, parked nearby. Later, at his trial, in August 2016, officers would testify that Shaw consented to a search of the car. (Shaw told me he didn’t.) They also claimed to smell marijuana, although the doors were shut and the windows were up. Shaw’s attorney, Maryland public defender Angela Oetting, said that’s a claim Baltimore cops often use to justify searches of her clients. The police did not, in fact, find marijuana in the car. But they did claim to find a gun, stashed in the glove compartment. It was a discovery that stunned Shaw, who said he has never owned a gun. “And this was my mom’s car,” he added. He was arrested and charged with two offenses: illegal possession of a handgun and possession of a handgun in a vehicle on a public road, punishable by up to three years in prison. Police had no evidence, such as fingerprints, to prove the gun was Shaw’s. He didn’t even have a key to the glove compartment the cops had to smash it open. After less than a   of deliberation, the jury found Shaw innocent on both counts. But Shaw is still paying for the crime he never committed. He’s on the hook for the $10, 000 his family agreed to pay the bail bondsman who got him out of jail two days after his arrest. In Maryland, as in the many other jurisdictions that rely on private bondsmen and a money bail system, bail arrangements are private contracts, unrelated to court outcomes. Innocent, guilty, or charges dropped —  as often is the case —  the bondsman still collects his fee. “It’s crazy,” Shaw said. But it’s the inevitable result of a privatized pretrial system dependent on a commercial   industry. The stated purpose of cash bail is to ensure that defendants show up in court and that dangerous people stay off the streets. By requiring some amount of money up front and threatening further cash penalties, defendants are motivated to comply. Or so the theory goes. But it’s increasingly clear that cash bail doesn’t accomplish these goals either fairly or efficiently, and that alternatives that don’t require defendants to pay for their release are actually more effective. In the large swaths of the country that still rely on cash bail, it’s all too often the poor —  not the dangerous or delinquent —  who remain behind bars when they can’t afford to purchase their freedom. Those who do pay bail, like Shaw, often find themselves in another kind of prison: shackled for months or years to a debt that hobbles their opportunities to get ahead. And it’s the government, prodded along by a powerful bail lobby, that enables the industry’s privileged position by providing a steady stream of clients, by protecting the industry’s right to collect, and by unthinkingly setting bail amounts that leave defendants little choice but to finance their freedom with a bondsman. In Shaw’s case, the district court commissioner who handled his arraignment set bail at $100, 000. His fiancée and his mother scraped together what they had, and Shaw cleaned out his meager savings. They gave it all to their bail bondsman, who agreed to bail Shaw out —  to be his “surety” —  for a fee of 10 percent, or $10, 000. Shaw and his family said they paid the bondsman about $2, 000 up front, with a promise to pay $100 a week until the amount was paid in full. Shaw earns $10. 15 an hour installing trailer hitches for  . “I’ll be paying for a long time,” he told me. “Like forever. ” One reason Baltimore’s     industry is thriving is the sheer number of arrests every day. From January 1 to September 30, 2016, Baltimore police made 19, 905 arrests, including 2, 136 in September alone —  an average of 70 a day. Most of those arrested were young black men. Nor is Baltimore an outlier in the zealousness —  or overzealousness —  of its police force. Thanks in part to “zero tolerance” policies and other crackdowns across the country, police made about 10. 8 million arrests in 2015, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics. Only a fraction of these arrests result in prosecutions, let alone in trials or convictions. Some of this has to do with the lack of capacity on the part of prosecutors to keep up with the flood of arrests. But in Baltimore, at least, many arrests are simply unwarranted to begin with. According to a 2016 investigation of the Baltimore Police Department by the U. S. Department of Justice, local prosecutors threw out more than 11, 000 charges between 2010 and 2015 “because they lacked probable cause or otherwise did not merit prosecution. ” The Justice Department concluded that Baltimore police habitually engaged in unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests, often disproportionately targeted at minorities. Justified or not, these arrests are a principal source of traffic at the Baltimore city jail. Adding to the scrum at central booking is another peculiarity of Maryland law: the ability of any citizen to file a complaint with a   commissioner if police or prosecutors don’t investigate. According to a report by the state of Maryland, more than four in 10 of the warrants issued by   commissioners in 2012 were based on citizen complaints, which require no investigation beyond a sworn statement by the complainant. All of these arrests are a great source of business for Baltimore’s bail bondsmen, who are a fixture in the city’s urban landscape. “Finding a bail bondsman is like finding a barber or a grocery store,” said Greg Carpenter, the founder of 2AM Bakery, a Baltimore business that rehabilitates  . “Where crime is really prevalent and people are going to jail every day, bail bondsmen are as common as anything else. ” Competition is fierce. Despite a statutory prohibition on soliciting business near jails, bondsmen prowl the turf near central booking, looking for desperate loved ones of people in lockup. Shaw’s fiancée, Destiny, told me she was approached by several bondsmen when she went to visit Shaw immediately after his arrest. “A lot of people come up to you and say, ‘I’m a bail bondsman,’” she said. “It’s a hustle for them. ” Still, it pays to choose the right bondsman. Maryland law caps the fee a bondsman can charge at 10 percent of bail. Some bondsmen try to undercut the competition with “discounts” on their fees. Others offer financing with just 1 percent down. Shaw’s fellow inmates recommended a bondsman who was reportedly cheap —  but in Annapolis. Unable to make the trip, Shaw’s mom and fiancée chose the option closest to the jail, the ironically named Baltimore Discount Bonds. The price they paid is like the price you get when you buy gas at the last station before the highway.   contracts, like the one the Shaws signed, tend to follow a similar formula. They provide that the fee charged —  the “premium” —  is “fully earned” and “not refundable” once a person is released. They also often give bondsmen full access to all aspects of a bailee’s personal life. At Lexington National, for example, one of the nation’s largest   companies, the standard contract available online gives the bail agent access to all “credit reports, Social Security Records, criminal records, civil records, driving records, tax records, telephone records, medical records, school records, worker compensation records, and employment records,” as well as the right to “attach a location tracking device on any vehicle owned or driven” by the bailee. Shaw’s mother, Rosetta Wise, told me she is the principal guarantor on her son’s bail contract. She said the bondsman calls her every few weeks, threatening garnishment if the debt isn’t paid. Once, Shaw said, the bondsman came to offer a deal: $2, 000 now to wipe out the debt. They couldn’t afford it. Wise has been covering the last several months of payments while Shaw and Destiny try to get back on their feet. Shaw continues to work at   and Destiny works in the flower shop and the deli at a local supermarket, but her schedule is unpredictable and her hours have been cut back. Complicating matters further is that they have a new baby, Kay, who was four months old at the time I met Shaw. In   I visited them at their home, a dilapidated Section 8   apartment in East Baltimore with a bodega in the basement. The living room had a couch against one wall, an armchair, and a baby swing, where Kay was napping in a fuzzy pink and purple   sleeper. A   TV, tuned to Disney Junior, was the sole indulgence. There was one window, and no pictures hung on the   walls that may once have been cream. “There’s no way I can pull it off,” said Shaw of the $100 payments he owes each week. But it bothered him that his mother is paying the bondsman, and it was a clear source of tension between his mother and Destiny. In a speakerphone call while I was there, Shaw’s mother and his fiancée started disputing who paid what and how much. “You see what bail does to a family?” Shaw said. “Bail is similar to homeowners’ or auto insurance,” said Jeff Kirkpatrick, a bail bondsman in Jackson, Michigan, who is also executive vice president of the Professional Bail Agents of the United States, a trade association. “Say you went to jail for shoplifting or larceny and the judge set your bail at $10, 000,” Kirkpatrick told me. “In most states, you would pay 10 percent to 15 percent of that bond amount as a premium. In return, the bond agent is guaranteeing the court that should you fail to appear and the bail agent failed to produce you, they would pay the court that $10, 000. ” In truth, the “premiums” paid by defendants cover the fees that bail agents themselves pay to large insurance companies to guarantee payment on a bail bond. If somebody jumps bail, a bondsman calls on his insurer he doesn’t put up the cash himself or deed over his house. Bondsmen are essentially brokers for these bigger firms. In Rafiq Shaw’s case, for example, his court files indicate that the surety of record is Crum  Forster Insurance, a subsidiary of a   international conglomerate, Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited. Crum  Forster is one of 14 national insurance companies and several regional insurance companies that specialize in cash bail. Many of them are members of the American Bail Coalition, another trade association for the bail industry. The profit a bondsman makes is the difference between the premiums charged to a defendant and the premiums the bondsman has to pay the insurance company. That gives bondsmen an incentive to ensure that their clients show up in court: Forfeiting a bond would have the same effect on their insurance as totaling a car. Kirkpatrick argued that this aspect of his business is a public service. “The bail agents do all the work they do at no cost to the taxpayer,” he said. “It’s one of those   partnerships that work really well. We’ve done a very good job of making sure that suspects appear. ” But the biggest “risk” bondsmen seem to assess is whether defendants can pay their premiums. While shows like Dog the Bounty Hunter have popularized the idea of fearless bondsmen on the hunt for dangerous suspects,   bail bonding has more in common with the sketchier side of the   industry than with law enforcement. The website of the Professional Bail Agents of the United States includes a page titled “How to Become a Bail Agent. ” Half of the text is about choosing an insurance company to back your bail bonds there is nothing about physical risk. “The bail profession is probably more about whom you know (or rather who knows you) than what you know,” the site says. Moreover, police officers are often the ones who end up doing the work of finding defendants who jump bail. “Of those that fail to appear, it’s not bondsmen who bring them in,” said Steve Chin, a pretrial services officer in Mesa County, Colorado, and spokesman for the Colorado Association of Pretrial Services. “Ninety percent of them are being arrested by law enforcement. The only ones I see bondsmen bring in are the ones who’ve made an agreement with a bondsman for a fee and didn’t pay it back. ” Nonetheless, the bail industry has worked hard to insulate its position by pursuing and winning favorable legislation in the states. For example, while some states, like Maryland, cap premiums at a fixed percentage, other states also set a minimum amount, eliminating room for price competition. In Virginia, for example, state law requires that bail bondsmen “shall not charge a   premium less than 10 percent or more than 15 percent of the amount of the bond. ” Some states have also passed laws requiring judges to set money bail for certain kinds of offenses, such as domestic violence, thereby foreclosing judges from other options, such as release on personal recognizance. For example, until the recent passage of   legislation that goes into effect next year, New Jersey required money bail for 18 offenses, including murder and kidnapping but also resisting arrest, theft by extortion, and “corrupting or influencing a jury. ” Many jurisdictions also rely on “bail schedules” that require fixed amounts of bail for particular offenses with no discretion for judges. In Los Angeles County, for example, a charge of   robbery carries a mandatory bail of $100, 000. Other states grant bondsmen grace periods of up to two years before a bond is fully forfeited. In Florida, for example, bondsmen have up to two years to produce a   before they forfeit a bond. Even if the police happen to pick up a fugitive on a bench warrant, the bondsman still gets a refund if he “substantially attempt[ed]” to find a defendant. Many of these   laws were passed during the 1990s as the result of an extensive effort by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council to promote the   industry. The ALEC website still includes model legislation for a variety of   bills, including variants of the legislation recently passed by New Jersey to require bail for certain offenses (the Alternative Method of Court Appearances Act and the Crimes with Bail Restrictions Act) a replica of the Florida legislation providing a grace period for bondsmen to track down bail jumpers (the Bail Forfeiture Relief and Remissions Act) and a proposal requiring the expiration of bail bonds after 36 months (the Bail Bonds Expiration Act). No one really knows how big the commercial   industry is in the United States. Some of the nation’s largest   insurers are either   such as Crum  Forster, or privately held, such as the American Surety Company, whose president is also chairman of the American Bail Coalition. A 2012 study by the Justice Policy Institute estimated that the industry writes roughly $14 billion in bail bonds per year, and the Professional Bail Agents of the United States says that there are about 14, 000 bail agents nationwide. “If I just wanted to make a lot of money, I’d get into the bonding business,” said Cherise Fanno Burdeen, executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that opposes the use of cash bail. “It’s high profit and almost zero risk. ” In fact, the majority of people currently in the nation’s jails are defendants legally presumed innocent and awaiting trial. According to the U. S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, 467, 500 of the nation’s 744, 592 jail inmates in   —  or 63 percent —  were “unconvicted” defendants in pretrial status, up from roughly 56 percent of the nation’s 621, 149 jail inmates in 2000. Most are unlikely to commit new crimes or fail to show up in court. According to a 2015 survey by the National Association of Counties, 69 percent of county jail administrators judged the majority of their inmates to be “ ” defendants. One reason for the rise in pretrial inmates is a rise in the use of money bail. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that judges set money bail on   of felony defendants in 2004, compared with half in 1990. Much of the time, the bail amounts are too high for a defendant to afford, even with the help of a bondsman. According to the same Bureau of Justice Statistics report, just one in 10 defendants with bail set at $100, 000 or more was released, compared with seven in 10 for defendants facing bail of $10, 000 or less. One study of defendants in Harris County, Texas, found that 39 percent of felony defendants with bail of $2, 000 or less couldn’t afford to get out, as well as 22 percent of misdemeanor defendants with bail of $500 or less. The inability to afford bail can have serious collateral consequences for defendants. For example, research by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation found that people detained pretrial were more than four times more likely to be sentenced to jail than people who were released, more likely to be given longer sentences, and more likely to be recidivists. People in jail are less able to meet with their lawyers, point them toward important witnesses, and put together the best defense. The disruptions resulting from staying in jail might mean the loss of a job or housing, which leads to economic instability or other consequences that could prompt a rearrest. People in pretrial detention are also more likely to plead guilty before the trial, because that might be the only way to avoid spending months or years in jail awaiting their time in court. In Baltimore, defendants who can’t make bail within 24 hours of their arrest are entitled to a bail review hearing, which takes place every morning at 11 at the district court on Wabash Avenue. At the hearing, a judge reviews the district court commissioner’s initial bail determination to decide if the bail amount should be changed. Similar proceedings take place in many other jurisdictions around the country, and in Baltimore, at least, the result is yet one more level of capriciousness in the   system. While hearings take place in district court, the defendants are still in lockup at central booking. They appear in court via video on a screen at the left wall of the courtroom. This means that defendants who have questions for their attorneys can’t confer with their counsel in private. The resolution is grainy, and what you see are about a dozen men in yellow jumpsuits, mostly black or Hispanic, seated four at a time in rows of folding chairs with one empty chair up front. Individual faces are too difficult to make out —  which is perhaps fitting, given the routinized nature of each hearing. Under Maryland law, the judges who hear bail reviews are supposed to consider a variety of factors in deciding the conditions of a defendant’s release. These factors include not just the nature of the crimes charged, but also the defendant’s family ties in the area, work history, and prior record of appearances, as well as the recommendation of pretrial services, prosecutors, and the defendant’s own attorney. But within this structure, judges have immense discretion. “It matters so much who the judge is,” Baltimore assistant public defender Nila Bala, one of the attorneys assigned to bail reviews, told me. “That matters more than anything else —  more than the client, the charges, me, the state’s attorney, or any other factor. And the judges vary widely in what they will do in certain cases. ” To defend her clients, Bala drives to central booking at 7:30 every morning to interview the clients who are due for their hearings that day. She has about an hour to speak to her dozen clients before she jumps back in her car to get to the courthouse on time. If she’s lucky, she has spent 10 minutes with each of them —  most of it spent shouting on a phone through a glass partition, surrounded by other lawyers and their clients all doing the same thing. Bala said her goal is to persuade the judge to reduce her clients’ bail —  or at least not increase it. But on this day in September, her victories are few. Judge Kent Boles, who is presiding today, calls a defendant on the screen, who shuffles toward the empty chair up front. Boles recites the charges and asks if the defendant understands the crimes he’s been accused of committing. After a   rundown of the defendant’s address, education level, and prior record by a representative of pretrial services, the state’s attorney argues to maintain the current bail or even increase it, based on statements provided by police and witnesses. The defendant’s attorney then has a chance to respond. Much of what’s presented at these hearings is hearsay evidence that would likely be inadmissible at trial, but no objections or   are permitted. Each hearing takes about 10 minutes. First up is Michael Atkinson, who faces four charges of   assault,   assault, and conspiracy to commit assault. His bail was initially set at $50, 000, and pretrial services notes a failure to appear from 2004. Bala points out that this occurred more than a decade ago and asks for a reduction in bail to $10, 000. The request is denied. Next up is Khourtney Woodard, charged with possession of drugs with intent to distribute and currently held without bail. Bala’s colleague, public defender Elizabeth Whitman, argues that a defendant who is arrested for nonviolent drug violations, and who is a lifelong resident of Baltimore and unlikely to flee the city, should be allowed to bail himself out. A few minutes after Whitman makes her case, the judge reduces Woodard’s bail to $500, 000 —  a meaningless reduction for an indigent defendant. The cases quickly take on a numbing sameness. Emmanuel Rose. Armed robbery,   assault, and theft of less than $100. Initial bail: $100, 000. No reduction. Samuel Faust. Handgun on person. Initial bail: $200, 000. No reduction. In one case, Boles reduces bail from $50, 000 to $25, 000. The defendant is Amir Barnes, who is charged with possession with intent to distribute. Bala argues that Barnes has no prior record and was caught with only 10 grams of marijuana. Court records show that Barnes was later able to bail himself out. The surety of record: Lexington National, one of the nation’s largest commercial bail companies. There is a simple solution to the myriad of problems caused by money bail: Abolish it. What happens instead to defendants awaiting trial should depend on their actual risk to public safety and the odds of their being a   in court. Under a “ ” system such as this, judges first decide whether a defendant is safe enough to release pending trial. Dangerous defendants stay in, while   defendants get out. The conditions of release for these   defendants, however, would depend on the likelihood of their flight or rearrest. For example, some defendants might be required to check in weekly with a   officer, while others might simply be released on their own recognizance. Still others might be required to post a money bond, but the amount would depend on their ability to pay. The states that have already moved or are moving to such a   system are Kentucky, Colorado, Alaska, and New Jersey, all of which have recently passed or are implementing   legislation that would dramatically reduce, if not end, the use of cash bail. In November, New Mexico voters approved a constitutional amendment prohibiting the detention of defendants solely because of their inability to pay bail. (In the District of Columbia —  which long ago effectively eliminated money bail —  the pretrial justice system has come under fire for   mistakes in releasing defendants due to what The Washington Post editorial board characterized as the lack of “a sound system that uses reliable data to assess risks. ”) One factor driving this current wave of bail reform is new research finding that alternatives to   money bail work better to ensure that defendants show up in court. A 2013 study by the Pretrial Justice Institute, funded by the Department of Justice, found that “unsecured” bonds, which require no money up front but are due in full if someone skips town, are just as effective as traditional cash bail in ensuring court appearances and preventing rearrests. In a controlled experiment in Colorado, defendants released on an unsecured bond, regardless of their risk, were less likely to commit new crimes than defendants released on traditional money bail. And all but the   defendants were more likely to show up in court. A 2011 study funded by the Justice Department also found that simply mailing defendants a reminder to show up in court significantly reduced the number of people who failed to appear. In an experiment involving more than 7, 800 misdemeanor defendants in Nebraska, only 8. 3 percent failed to show up after getting a mailed reminder about their court date, along with information about what would happen if they failed to show. By comparison, 12. 6 percent of defendants who got no such reminder were  . A second factor driving bail reform is the emergence of new   tools —  known as “risk assessment instruments” —  to help judges decide whether a defendant should be released into the community and on what conditions. These instruments are helping make a “ ” alternative to cash bail viable. In Colorado, for example, which passed   legislation in 2013, many judges now use the Colorado Pretrial Assessment Tool, or CPAT, a   matrix that assesses a defendant’s risk of flight and danger to the community using such variables as age of first arrest, prior failures to appear, and current   issues or alcohol and drug problems. Although Colorado still has a commercial   industry, it has shrunk dramatically since the passage of the new law, said Steve Chin of the Colorado Association of Pretrial Services. In Mesa County, where Chin works, the use of traditional money bail fell from 65 percent of cases in 2011 to 39 percent in 2014 without any increase in rates of failures to appear or new crimes committed by defendants released into the community. A third factor driving reform is that states are realizing how expensive it is to house all these inmates awaiting trial, especially when so many of them are “ . ” According to the Arnold Foundation, the cost of pretrial detention alone is at least $9 billion a year. Alaska, for example, passed bail reform in the spring of 2016 as part of a sweeping   reform effort after legislators saw that the state’s largest prison —  the Goose Creek Correctional Center in Point MacKenzie —  was already running out of room after its opening in 2012. According to a report by the Alaska Criminal Justice Commission, Alaska’s jail population was growing at three times the rate of overall population growth in the state. Much of this growth was in the pretrial population, which grew 81 percent over the last decade. This growth, the commission found, was driven by reliance on cash bail. “Our prison population trajectory was such that we’d have to build another prison within the next four years,” said state senator John Coghill, the lead sponsor of Alaska’s reforms. With the state already spending nearly 10 percent of its budget on corrections, building yet another prison was unpalatable to lawmakers. As a result of all this activity, momentum is growing at the national level, too. Earlier this year, California Democratic Representative Ted Lieu introduced legislation that would require states to abolish cash bail as a condition of receiving federal grant support for state and local police. In December 2015, the White House convened a conference on excessive fines and fees in the   system that also included a look at cash bail. Aspects of money bail are also under fresh judicial challenge. A pending   suit in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Walker v. City of Calhoun, is challenging the constitutionality of bail “schedules” like the one in Los Angeles County. In an amicus brief filed on behalf of the plaintiff, an indigent Georgia defendant named Maurice Walker, the U. S. Department of Justice argued that “bail practices that incarcerate indigent individuals before trial solely because of their inability to pay for their release violates the Fourteenth Amendment. ” And in Maryland, home to Rafiq Shaw, the state attorney general released an advisory opinion in October 2016 concluding that the state’s current   system could be unconstitutional, on the grounds that imposing bail defendants can’t afford may violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on “excessive bail” and the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process. In late November, the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Maryland Court of Appeals recommended overhauling the state’s bail system, a significant first step toward reform and one that has taken advocates years to achieve. By eliminating cash bail, states can ensure that poverty isn’t the only reason a defendant stays behind bars, and they can end the predation of   defendants by a commercial   industry motivated more by profit than by protecting public safety. Getting rid of money bail would also stop the absurdity of cases like Rafiq Shaw’s —  where an innocent man is paying for the mistakes of prosecutors and police. “Bail is not fair,” said Shaw, who is now working to get his arrest record expunged so he can find a better job. “I’m not guilty. The case is over. ” The era of cash bail should end, too."
53371,73568,Can James Mattis Protect Trump From Hubris?,Atlantic,Dominic Tierney,2017-01-14,2017.0,1.0,,"   In ancient Rome, the ultimate honor was to receive a triumph, or a lavish parade through Rome to celebrate a great military victory. The hero would ride a chariot, accompanied by the veterans of the campaign and the plunder of war —  the ranks of prisoners, vessels of gold, crowns of pearls, and placards bearing the names of conquered nations —  all the way to the Temple of Jupiter where he would make a sacrifice to the god. According to ancient sources, a slave stood in the great man’s chariot, held a golden crown over his head, and whispered in his ear, “remember you are a man. ” At the very moment of exultation, the honoree was given a word of warning: You are mortal and glory is transient. Donald Trump is about to enjoy his own triumph —  the inauguration as president. There may never have been a president more at risk of hubris. Where is the voice whispering in his ear, urging humility? Senate Confirmation Hearings: Day 3, Psychologists have found that most people are prone to overconfidence about their own abilities and control over events. In a 2004 survey of almost 1 million high school students, just 2 percent rated their leadership skills as “below average. ” Motorcyclists, businessmen, college professors, Bungee jumpers —  all tend to think they’re better than the norm. Overconfidence can also vary significantly. Men tend to be more overconfident than women (although some studies suggest this isn’t always the case). Americans are more overconfident than East Asians. As two psychologists put it, “Americans are widely regarded as the most optimistic people on earth. ” Elites are more prone to overconfidence, whether they’re   chess players or masters of the universe on Wall Street. Given all this, Donald Trump seems almost uniquely likely to succumb to hubris. Not only is he male, American, and a member of the elite (for all his talk of populism) but he also instinctively responds to challenges by coming out swinging, and is prone to narcissistic or arrogant behavior, such as declaring he doesn’t need daily intelligence briefings, where he says he would hear “the same thing in the same words every single day. ” At different times, Trump has retweeted a quote from Benito Mussolini (“It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep”) and lauded Saddam Hussein (“you know what he did well? He killed terrorists”) —  two autocrats known for their   overconfidence. The initial months of a Trump presidency present particular risks of hubris. Early on, presidents may be tempted by wild adventures, before the realities of office temper their hopes and dreams. Soon after taking the oath of office, JFK gave the green light to the outlandishly flawed Bay of Pigs invasion. George W. Bush espoused missionary crusading zeal after   but cut a more chastened figure in his second term. Overconfidence can be a useful trait in some ways, by encouraging leaders to persevere in the face of obstacles. But illusions of triumph can also lead to catastrophic decisions like the invasion of Iraq, where officials predicted that U. S. troops would be greeted as liberators, and neglected the chances of disorder or insurgency following regime change. A RAND study found that in   analyses: “post conflict stabilization and reconstruction were addressed only very generally, largely because of the prevailing view that the task would not be difficult. ” What if Trump encounters an unexpected   crisis in the early months of his administration? What if North Korea launches a fresh provocation? What if Trump deploys larger numbers of military forces to the Middle East to combat jihadi terrorists? It is difficult or impossible to   against overconfidence. Ironically, a classic example of positive illusions is that people believe they are better than their peers at seeing things accurately, uncontaminated by overconfidence. The most effective way to check hubris is to empower outsiders, such as a board of directors who can hold a CEO accountable. Trump doesn’t have a board, but he does have a Cabinet. Trump once said that he might not come to the aid of NATO allies. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed unworried because Trump’s advisers would take a different perspective. “I don’t think that view would be prevalent or held by anybody he might make secretary of state or secretary of defense. ” But will Trump listen to his team? Research shows that inexperienced presidents often rely on a narrower range of advisers, and may not defer to those more experienced for fear of looking weak. And it’s not clear that the incoming national security adviser, the retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, or secretary of state designate Rex Tillerson will be an effective check on the president. This week, for example, in his Senate confirmation hearings, Tillerson struggled to answer predictable questions about his perceived softness toward Russia and President Vladimir Putin. And no one expects Trump’s       and senior policy adviser, Jared Kushner, to lecture the president if he oversteps. Much rests, therefore, on the shoulders of Trump’s nominee for secretary of defense, James Mattis. He is no yes man. Mattis is a   retired Marine Corps general who headed U. S. Central Command. There are two sides to Mattis, captured by his nicknames. One is “Mad Dog,” the   fighter who speaks his mind and knows that war means killing: “There are some assholes in the world that just need to be shot. ” And then there’s Mattis the “Warrior Monk,” the   with a library of thousands of books of military history, who helped oversee the writing of the Army and Marine Corps’ field manual on   which stressed winning “hearts and minds” and using limited firepower. Mattis should sail through the confirmation process. In his Senate hearings, Mattis leashed the mad dog, and offered a calm warrior monk appraisal of the world: Putin is a threat, global order is at risk, and alliances are critical to American security. There was hyperbole in Mattis’s claim that the world order is “under the biggest attack since World War II,” which ignored the Cold War, and the Soviet and Chinese efforts to bury the West. But the senators seemed to find the centrist internationalism on show to be deeply reassuring. Americans need someone who will educate, encourage, and if necessary, restrain, an inexperienced president. Mattis has been known to carry a book of quotes from Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor. With an eye on Roman history, perhaps he can be the chariot whisperer."
53372,73574,The Shadow Network of Anti-Vax Doctors,Atlantic,Olga Khazan,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0,,"When Andrew Brandeis encounters patients who are skeptical about vaccines at his   clinic in San Francisco, he doesn’t toe the typical pediatrician party line —  that the standard vaccine schedule is a  . Instead, he might help the patient delay or space out their child’s shots beyond the recommendations of   agencies, if they so desire. “The earlier you introduce a vaccine to a kid, there is evidence suggesting various adverse reactions,” he said. He believes early administration of the Hepatitis B vaccine is linked to allergies, asthma, and multiple sclerosis —  something doctors and health agencies vehemently deny. “The parents might say, ‘I’m just going to wait on that one,’ I’d say that’s okay. ” He doesn’t actively promote this delay strategy, and he said he administers more vaccines than he avoids. Still, his own    daughter is unvaccinated, since as Brandeis sees it, “the risks outweigh the benefits. ” The prospect of his child wheezing away with a   infection is not his biggest fear. “Measles isn’t going to kill your kid anymore. This isn’t the late 1800s when sanitary conditions were horrible,” he said. Besides, he added, “kids are supposed to get sick they’re supposed to get childhood illnesses, it’s what builds the immune system. ” (Mainstream medical groups counter that obtaining immunity from inoculations is not deadly meanwhile, spreading a communicable disease can cause many deaths.) Brandeis is one of a sizable number of doctors who allow their patients to avoid or delay vaccines if they are concerned about their health effects. It’s unknown how many of these physicians there are, but dozens of names —  some even organized by state —  come up on earthy mommy blogs and other web communities. “We are hoping to find a   group in the   …     area who is an MD, but   to alternative medicine, as well as less aggressive vaccination schedules,” wrote one California parent on the Berkeley Parents Network in December. These doctors —  and patients who seek them out —  could be emboldened if   Donald Trump goes through with the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy, an environmental activist and vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead a commission “on vaccine safety and scientific integrity,” as was reported last week. Trump met with Kennedy in Trump Tower on January 10, and Kennedy later told his   colleagues that he would be taking a leave to chair the vaccine commission. (Trump’s team said later that no decision had been made yet.) It wouldn’t be Trump’s first flirtation with the   community. “You take this little beautiful baby and you pump —  I mean, it looks like just it’s meant for a horse and not for a child,” he said last year about the vaccine schedule. “We had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, 2 years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. ”  In August, Trump met with British researcher Andrew Wakefield, who concocted the   connection in 1998 and whose work has been widely discredited as fraudulent. “  beliefs track closely with lack of confidence in the government,” Arthur Allen, the author of Vaccine: The controversial story of medicine’s greatest lifesaver, told Politico’s Pulse Check podcast recently. “We’re in the middle of the perfect situation for [  beliefs] to rise. ” * * * Brandeis is a naturopathic physician, or ND, a type of alternative medicine specialist who uses herbs, supplements, and lifestyle counseling alongside standard medical treatments. Most NDs get thousands of hours less formal training than do traditional family doctors, and 20 states license them to practice. Brandeis says other than the focus on holistic health, his practice resembles that of any other family physician —  except that he doesn’t accept insurance. Brandeis told me he has no opinion on Robert F. Kennedy or Trump’s vaccine commission, but “I’m looking forward to seeing if any new science is exposed. It’s really hard to get to the bottom of this one. ” By contrast, most mainstream doctors say the vaccine question is beyond settled: Vaccines are some of the safest and most important   measures around. There is no evidence they cause autism or any other health problem. Meanwhile, measles killed 130, 000 people in 2015 and can cause brain damage that lingers for years. What’s more, unvaccinated people don’t just threaten their own health. Outbreaks are more likely to occur during dips in the percentage of a population that’s immune. And some people —  like the   or elderly —  can’t receive certain vaccines, but they are still susceptible to getting sick if an outbreak occurs. A paper published in JAMA last year found that vaccine refusal was associated with an increased risk of measles among both the fully vaccinated and  . A high vaccine uptake rate protects the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. As pediatrician Aaron Carroll demonstrates in this video, not one child under the age of one died from the chicken pox between 2004 and 2007, even though the chicken pox vaccine is not given to children that young. They simply benefitted from the   “herd immunity” of older kids who were vaccinated. “People say it’s fine for you to choose what your child has,” said Kathryn Edwards, the chair of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, “but in some ways, you’re choosing what other children are exposed to. ” Vaccine hesitancy is already on the rise among patients. About 87 percent of pediatricians have encountered parents who have refused a vaccine, according to a 2013 survey from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and pediatricians said the percentage of parents refusing one or more vaccines had increased from 9 to 17 percent over the past seven years. Vaccines worked so well, Edwards said, that people have forgotten the agony of infectious disease. “It’s a little like the Maytag repair man,” she said. “We had such a wonderful product, so the diseases are gone, so people don’t worry about them. They worry more about adverse events. ” And yet, doctors are some of the most important persuaders of   parents. One study in Pediatrics found that 80 percent of parents said their decision to vaccinate was “positively influenced by their primary care provider. ” In a position paper, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends doctors try a “presumptive delivery strategy,” presenting vaccines as the standard and leaving little open to debate. For more reluctant patients, pediatricians might show patients pictures of their own, immunized, children, or use motivational interviewing —  asking questions with the goal of challenging the patient’s assumptions. The AAP paper even leaves open the option for doctors to dismiss patients who won’t immunize. An informal survey of dozens of American pediatricians conducted by Slate’s Brian Palmer in 2015 found about half turn away children who haven’t been vaccinated, either because they were worried about infecting other patients or because they felt it was a sign the   relationship wasn’t going well. The ones who didn’t reject   began each visit with questions like, “Can we talk about vaccines today? Is there anything I can tell you that would help you feel more comfortable?” Reasons for Vaccine Refusals in 2006 and 2013, Naturopathic and alternative medicine doctors, meanwhile, are more likely to nurture patients’   views. Children who saw alternative practitioners had a lower uptake of the flu shot only half of patients who saw a Canadian naturopathic practice in 2010 were fully vaccinated and in 2004 only 13 percent of Canadian NDs would advise full vaccination. Children in Washington state were less likely to be vaccinated if they received naturopathic care, and they were more likely to have a   disease. Parents who refused or delayed vaccines are more likely to say that their decision was influenced by a complementary or alternative medicine practitioner. Through a Google search, I found what purports to be a position paper on vaccines that was posted to the website of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Seemingly updated in 2011, the paper reads, “All physicians and institutions providing care for children and adults should respect the responsibility and freedom of patients, parents and guardians to decide whether or not to proceed with the immunizations or the recommended immunization schedule within the range of options provided by state law. ” A spokeswoman for the AANP had no comment on the paper or its authorship, and today the organization’s website simply says, “A task force of the AANP is revising the profession’s position paper on vaccination. ” Britt Hermes, a former naturopathic doctor who now advocates against   practitioners, says NDs are overwhelmingly  . During her studies at Bastyr University, a naturopathic medical school and Brandeis’s alma mater, she met one naturopath who promoted elderberry syrup as a substitute for the flu shot, she said. ”My pediatrics course at Bastyr trained us to deliver alternative vaccination schedules and taught that delaying childhood immunizations was a reasonable choice for any child,” Hermes wrote in an email. “My pediatric course also required a writing assignment on a vaccine preventable disease and a discussion of the risks and benefits of immunization. The Vaccine Book by [vaccine skeptic] Dr. Bob Sears was listed twice on my course syllabi. ” Alternative schedules —   vaccines spread out over a longer period of time —  are a common   between mainstream doctors and   but most medical organizations say they are unproven and risky, since children can still contract diseases while waiting to receive their shots. A representative of Bastyr University said the school now refers    to the CDC as a “resource on immunizations. ” “As advocates of preventive medicine, we believe vaccines are a scientifically sound and effective method of preventing infectious diseases,” the university said in a statement. “We recommend immunizations to protect children and adults from adverse consequences of infectious disease. ” However, Bastyr’s statement also suggested immunizing can have downsides, adding “students are trained to discuss the safety, benefits, and risks of vaccines to all patients. ” It provided links to the websites of several Bastyr graduates, now running their own practices, who give patients “informed choice” over vaccines and help them “navigate through vaccine information and alternative vaccination schedules. ” Not all naturopathic physicians oppose vaccines. Matt Brignall, a naturopathic doctor and clinical instructor at Bastyr, said he teaches the conventional,   vaccination schedule in his courses. He would like to see a tightening of vaccine exemption rules, does not advocate alternate schedules, and opposes Trump’s purported choice of Kennedy to study vaccines. “Note that this type of fake inquiry is likely to increase the public perception of risk, leading in turn to further drops in vaccine coverage rates,” he told me via email. And yet, it’s not just naturopathic doctors who doubt vaccines. Earlier this month, Daniel Neides, a medical doctor and director of the Wellness Institute of the Cleveland Clinic, wrote a column for the news site Cleveland. com that questioned the safety of vaccines, saying they come “at the expense of neurologic diseases like autism and ADHD. ” After a PR firestorm, the Cleveland Clinic disavowed the column and said it would stop selling homeopathic treatments in its gift shops. (Neides declined to comment further.) Jay Gordon, a   pediatrician in Santa Monica, California, estimates that about 90 percent of his patients are not on a typical vaccine schedule. “I get vaccines,” he said, “but I don’t believe that the vaccine schedule that we have now is the best way of doing it. ” He said that he would, after a discussion, support a patient who didn’t want to vaccinate at all, though he realizes the patient would be contributing to the erosion of herd immunity. “One reason the risk [of infectious disease] is small is because of vaccines, and I don’t want things to change overnight,” he said. “I don’t want to abandon all vaccines, and I don’t like the   agenda. ” “It gives me the luxury of being disliked by both ends of the spectrum,” he added. * * * The Kennedy news sparked worries among some doctors that Trump will wrench responsibility for vaccines away from the CDC and hand the reigns to a   panel, or that he will dismantle programs that protect vaccine makers from frivolous lawsuits. In the meantime, he risks shaking the public’s trust in a vaccination schedule that has saved millions of lives and allowed Americans to live 30 years longer. As the recent wave of   alarm has shown, confidence in vaccines works similarly to herd immunity. It takes a universal acceptance of fact, and a rejection of conspiracy theories, to get every parent’s  . Last week, Kennedy told reporters, “Everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have . .. [are] as safe as they possibly can be.” But doctors say even the hint that patients need such “assurance” is toxic. After all, people question vaccines because authority figures raise questions about them. Patients don’t question whether it’s the right choice to eat apples, because doctors and politicians have never suggested that the jury is still out on fruit. As Daniel Summers, a pediatrician in New England, wrote in the Washington Post recently, “The mere creation of the commission, meant to investigate a question that has already been asked and answered many times over, is ominous. ”"
53373,73575,The Trump Promise Tracker,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0,,"All politicians make campaign promises, though few made them with the abandon, spontaneity, and flamboyance of Donald Trump. During the campaign, he would casually guarantee vast and circumstantial shifts in policy, often saying he’d do them on day one. (The Washington Post tallied up an eyepopping 282 promises the Republican nominee made.) These ranged from the monumental —  the famous wall Trump vowed to build on the U. S. border with Mexico, with Mexican funds —  to the vague (what does it mean to drain the swamp, exactly?) to the highly concrete, like his outlined expansion of the U. S. military. In this jaded age, it’s customary to assume that campaign promises are just that and won’t be remembered. But studies have found that most politicians do in fact keep most of the promises they make to voters while running for office. Will Trump follow through on his array of guarantees? Or will a president who developed a vast record of dishonesty in private life and as a politician fall short of his promises as president? We’ve assembled a list of some of the Trump’s most notable and circumstantial promises here. The list is not comprehensive, but it touches on most of his biggest priorities. (Think we missed one? Get in touch to recommend an addition.) As President Trump advances in his term, we’ll track his progress (or lack thereof) toward the goals he’s laid out, updating this article regularly. Promise: No idea was so central to Trump’s run for president as his promise that he would build a wall stretching across the U. S. border with Mexico, in order to prevent illegal immigration. Outlook: Setting aside whether or not the wall is an effective solution to illegal immigration, some analysts have long suggested that the idea to build a wall was either prohibitively expensive or topographically impossible, due to the various landscapes on the border. But there are those who believe a wall could be built. That’s assuming Trump wants to build it, of course. Several top Trump supporters have suggested the wall might be “digital,” “a metaphor,” “virtual,” or “technological. ” Status: Incomplete, Promise: Of course, one reason it was easy for Trump to guarantee such a sprawling project was that he also insisted Mexico would pay for the work. Outlook: Mexico’s president, as well as other current and former officials, insist that the country will not pay. Trump laid out a series of steps he believes will force it to ante up. Uri Friedman walks through how effective they might be and what repercussions they could have. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump says he will triple the staffing at Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and add 5, 000 agents to the ranks of the Border Patrol. He made the pledges in his August speech about immigration policy in Arizona. Outlook: The main question here is money —  Aaron Blake estimates more than $15 billion. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Currently, some immigrants who are caught entering the United States without authorization are given summons to appear in court. Trump has said he will halt the practice. Outlook: Here again, it’s a matter of money: Incarcerating people takes money and facilities. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump’s specific ideas about deportations fluctuated at points during the campaign. At the bare minimum, he said he would deport 2 million undocumented immigrants who are criminals who are in the country now. (Experts say that figure is exaggerated.) He has at other times said he would mount a   effort to expel all unauthorized immigrants. Outlook: Deporting large numbers of people requires funding and serious political will, since it could be a intrusive process. Trump will also struggle to deport 2 million criminal aliens if there aren’t that many. Speaker Paul Ryan told 60 Minutes, “We’re not working on a deportation force. ” Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump says he will reverse Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama program that allows people who came to the U. S. without authorization as children to apply to stay in the country. Outlook: It appears that Trump could fairly easily reverse DACA, which Obama created through an executive order, with an executive order of his own. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump railed against “sanctuary cities,” municipalities that have installed policies of not alerting federal authorities about unauthorized immigrants. (They still prosecute them for other crimes.) He has said he will block federal funding for such cities. Outlook: It’s unclear how broad Trump’s authority to block funding for cities would be, even in concert with Congress. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Early in the campaign, Trump said he would ban all Muslim immigration to the United States, and that statement remains on his website. At other times, he has said he would only ban Muslim immigration from countries with a history of terrorism, or that he would institute “extreme vetting” for refugees in order to prevent the entry of   terrorists. Outlook: A Muslim ban would likely run into constitutional difficulties, though some scholars believe it could be structured to withstand scrutiny. Trump has not made a cogent explanation for how his “extreme vetting” would differ from the existing vetting process. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump says he will demand a better deal from NAFTA, the   agreement with Canada and Mexico that entered force in 1994. He says that if the other signatories will not agree to that he will withdraw the United States from the agreement. Outlook: Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto says Mexico is willing to discuss “modernizing” NAFTA, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signaled openness to renegotiation. But Trump might or might not be able to make changes to NAFTA or renegotiate it without congressional approval. Some experts say that withdrawal could spark a trade war that could damage the American economy. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on goods produced outside of the U. S. by companies that have offshored jobs from the United States. He reprised that vow as recently as December 4. He also called for a 45 percent tariff on all Chinese imports. Outlook: Congress, rather than the president, generally has the power to enact tariffs. Republican leaders in Congress, who are closer to the traditional GOP dogma in favor of free trade, tend to take a dim view of Trump’s tariffs. Adding new tariffs could produce a trade war and higher costs to U. S. citizens. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump says he will create 25 million jobs, and in particular “bring back” manufacturing jobs. He also set a target of 4 percent annual economic growth. Outlook: It’s an ambitious target, some 2. 5 more jobs than Obama created —  working from the depth of a recession —  and more even than Bill Clinton, the recent record holder. Many economists believe simply bringing manufacturing jobs back from overseas will be impossible because of structural changes in the economy. They are also skeptical of the growth promise. Status: Incomplete. Trump has already scored a major PR victory by convincing Carrier to preserve some jobs in Indiana —  though the economic benefits are much less clear. Promise: Trump says he will withdraw the United States from the   Partnership, the multilateral deal with 11 countries. Outlook: Since Congress has not ratified the treaty, and has shown little appetite to do so, Trump should be able to achieve this fairly easily on his own. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump said he would restore jobs in coal mining in Appalachia that were lost under President Obama’s presidency, blaming the losses on environmental regulation. Outlook: Experts met Trump’s claims with overwhelming skepticism. A major factor behind the decline in coal is simple market forces: As natural gas becomes easier to extract, it has become cheaper, cutting into coal’s advantage. Coal reserves in Appalachia are also lower than ever. He might have better luck rolling back Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which he could refuse to defend in court or attempt to reverse via executive order. Status: Incomplete, Promise: In March, Trump told The Washington Post that he would eliminate the national debt, which currently stands at nearly $20 trillion, in eight years. Outlook: Trump has not offered any viable plan for paying off the debt. An analysis of Trump’s proposals overall as of   found that he would sharply increase both budget deficits and the national debt. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump was highly critical of the U. S. deal with Iran to stop nuclear proliferation, saying, in September 2015, “I will renegotiate with Iran. ” He has not indicated how he would change the deal, but he also vowed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Outlook: Without any sense of what Trump wants, it’s hard to know whether he can achieve it. Iranian leaders have reacted fiercely against the idea of renegotiation. This area could be a test for Trump’s hypothesis that he can get better deals simply through force of negotiating skill. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump says that his solution to ISIS will be to “bomb the hell out of them” (or slight variations thereon) and to claim petroleum reserves for the United States. Outlook: The U. S. is already bombing ISIS, so it’s a question of degree. Who is to say when the shit is bombed out of them? As for the oil question, it’s thornier. It would require the U. S. to expropriate oil from Iraq and possibly Syria, which would likely elicit protests. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump has promised at various points to reinstitute torture. “Don’t tell me it doesn’t work —  torture works,” he said in February. He also promised to “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,” of which he said, “I like it a lot. I don’t think it’s tough enough. ” Outlook: As The New York Times reports, Trump would face some difficulties in reinstituting even the levels of torture that occurred during the Bush administration, to say nothing of more brutal tactics. Then again, before “enhanced interrogation” few expected the U. S. to torture. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump complains that America is overextended globally and is contributing more to alliances than it receives. Noting low spending by some NATO members, he has said he will not fulfill   obligations unless they increase their military spending to reach NATO’s mandatory minimums. Outlook: NATO allies have reacted nervously to the prospect of the alliance falling apart. NATO leaders have insisted the defense pact is unconditional. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump said the agreement that the Obama administration worked out with the Cuban regime to reestablish diplomatic relations is too weak. He has promised to negotiate a better deal or else reverse the opening. Outlook: Many Republicans in Congress were opposed to Obama’s Cuba opening and would prefer a harder line as long as the Communist government is in place. Generally, American public opinion favors an opening. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump has said he will expand the armed forces on every front. He wants to reverse the sequester for the Pentagon expand the Army from about 480, 000 to 540, 000 grow the Marines from 182, 000 to 200, 000 raise the Naval fleet from a planned 308 (much larger than today’s 272) to 350 and add about 100 fighter planes. Outlook: Regardless of whether this force is wise or necessary, the major requirement to achieving it is money. Experts expect it would cost an additional $100 billion or so over existing budgets. Status: Incomplete, Promise: After Kim   said in a New Year’s address that North Korea was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile, Trump replied via tweet, “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U. S. It won’t happen!” Outlook: Discerning North Korea’s true capabilities from its bluster is a constant challenge, but the experience of the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations has been that when the hermit kingdom’s technical capacities are real, the United States has little leverage over it. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump said he would “cancel” the international climate agreement struck in Paris last year. Outlook: It would be outside his power to “cancel” the whole agreement, but Trump could attempt to extricate the United States from the accord, which could in turn encourage others to exit. In theory, the U. S. cannot exit the deal before 2020, but the U. S. could withdraw from the framework behind the treaty with one year’s notice, effectively withdrawing from the treaty itself. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump says he wants to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, including the individual mandate to hold insurance, and replace it with something that is “so much better, so much better, so much better. ” He has offered few details on how to do that, though he has suggested   accounts and interstate markets for insurance as ideas. He also says he wants to ensure that anyone who wants insurance coverage can get it and afford it. Outlook: Repeal should be relatively easy, at least on a    level. Republicans in Congress are eager to do so, and much of it can be accomplished through the process of reconciliation, which removes procedural hurdles. But replacement will be more difficult, since it’s likely to be politically divisive. Removing benefits may also be politically perilous. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump said repeatedly that he would preserve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. “I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,” he told The Daily Signal in May 2015. “Every other Republican is going to cut, and even if they wouldn’t, they don’t know what to do because they don’t know where the money is. I do. ” In March 2016, he said, “They want to cut Social Security, which I’m not cutting. ..I’m the only one that’s not cutting it. ” However, he has also called for converting Medicaid into block grants to states, which can then handle the money as they see fit. He has seldom spoken about Medicare. Outlook: This is an area where there could be serious tension between Trump and Republicans in Congress. They should find common ground on   Medicaid, but many of them also want to cut Medicaid funding, convert Medicare into a voucher system, and privatize Social Security. That could conflict with Trump supporters who were adamant that he would help them keep entitlements. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump has offered a tax plan that would lower marginal tax rates, reduce the number of tax brackets, and produce overall lower taxes. He wants to repeal the estate tax, and would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. Families would be able to deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes. Trump would seek to close the   loophole, which allows   managers and   types, among others, to avoid paying income tax on large portions of their earnings. Outlook: This appears to be an area where Trump and congressional Republicans have common ground, although there may be some specific differences in their optimal scenarios. Trump’s plan will be costly, though: The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, in an October analysis, found that the Trump plan would reduce federal revenues by $6. 2 trillion over a decade, and that the federal debt would increase by $7 trillion in that time. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump has promised a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. Saying that the nation’s roads, bridges, electric lines, and other structures are crumbling, he wants to spend on rebuilding them, which he says would double as a jobs plan. Outlook: In recent history, Democrats have been strongly in favor of infrastructure projects, while Republicans have opposed them. Republicans have expressed skepticism about Trump’s plan since the election, particularly on how to pay for it. Incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has suggested his caucus might be willing to work with Trump on infrastructure, but other Democrats have denounced the plan as really just a tax break for corporations. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump says he will roll back the     law, including eliminating the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Outlook: Republicans in Congress also dislike   meaning Trump should have some leeway to dismantle the regulations. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Late in the campaign, Trump laid out a program of   steps that he labeled (somewhat grudgingly) “draining the swamp. ” He said he would impose a   ban on   officials lobbying the government after leaving the government, and ask that Congress do the same prevent a common practice in which former government officials do lobbying work but structure it so as to avoid registering as lobbyists banning senior White House officials for life from lobbying for foreign governments and asking Congress to prevent registered foreign lobbyists from raising money for U. S. elections. He also offered some vague rumblings about transparency. Trump promised a constitutional amendment to create congressional term limits. Outlook: It all depends how you define it. Trump’s specific steps are fairly narrow. The steps focused on the executive branch should be reasonably straightforward. Whether Congress will oblige on the others is unclear, but it has shown little appetite for either a strong lobbying ban or term limits. In many other ways, it’s hard to take Trump’s slogan all that seriously. He continues to refuse to release basic disclosures, including his tax returns and has made little serious gesture toward resolving serious conflicts of interest. After assailing Clinton for speaking to Goldman Sachs, he has appointed several alumni of the bank to top posts. His children have repeatedly had to back off   charity auctions. Two former aides have opened a lobbying shop that appears to mostly offer proximity to Trump. Moreover, despite the promise to bar officials from heading into lobbying, but his transition team was chock full of former lobbyists. Outcome: Incomplete, Promise: Trump has promised to end Common Core, a set of educational standards that have become a major conservative bogeyman. Outlook: Bad. Despite the way it’s often portrayed, Common Core is not a federal program or law but rather a set of standards adopted by 42 state governments. The Obama administration did make some federal funding contingent on adopting the standards, which Trump could reverse, but the president doesn’t have the power to abolish the Common Core itself. Status: Doomed, Promise: Trump made various vows related to guns during his campaign. “I will get rid of   zones on schools, and —  you have to —  and on military bases,” he said in January. “My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There’s no more   zones. ” He also pledged to “unsign” President Obama’s executive orders related to firearms. He wants to allow   permit holders to carry their guns in all 50 states. He also praised a Virginia project that introduced   minimum sentences for gun crimes, though mention has since disappeared from his site. Outlook: Trump is almost certain to break his first promise, since   zones are a product of legislation that would have to be repealed by Congress, which would probably take more than a day.   reciprocity bills have moved in Congress before, but would never have become law under Obama. Trump could likely reverse many executive orders with his own. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump said he would improve the VA health system, but suggested that if wait times are long, veterans should be able to get private care, paid for by the government. Outlook: Reforming the VA has proven a challenging task for presidents. The biggest challenge for a   alternative would likely be cost, but congressional Republicans have tended to look fondly on privatization of government functions. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump spent much of the campaign criticizing   advocates. In August, he said at a rally, “We’re not going to shoot our police. We’re not shooting our police. It’s never been so dangerous to be a policeman or woman. It’s never been so dangerous. ” Outlook: Trump is wrong on the facts —  the number of officers killed in the line of duty ticked up slightly in 2016, but is still well below the recent average. It’s unclear how Trump would even go about preventing all killing of police officers. Status: Incomplete, Promise: During a presidential debate in October, Trump promised that if elected he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate his opponent, Hillary Clinton. “I didn’t think I’d say this and I’m going to say it and I hate to say it .  …     If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception,” he said. He also led “Lock her up” chants at campaign events. Outlook: Trump has since backed off his promise, saying, “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, and admitting it no longer “plays well. ” Status: Dubious, Promise: Speaking to 60 Minutes shortly after the election, Trump said he would not take the $400, 000 presidential salary. However, he is required by law to accept some pay, so he’ll take $1 per year. Outlook: This should be no problem. Previous independently wealthy presidents John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover have also foregone salaries. Status: Incomplete, Promise: Trump says he is under audit by the IRS (a claim that is not independently verifiable) but that he will release his tax returns as soon as that is complete. Outlook: Trump is the only   presidential candidate, to say nothing of elected president, in decades not to release his returns. Status: Incomplete"
53374,73576,Obama and the Limits of ’Fact-Based’ Foreign Policy,Atlantic,Shadi Hamid,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0,,"They were the best and the brightest. But, most of all, they believed they were right. Although the scale of disaster was considerably different, the same that was said of those who oversaw foreign policy under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson could be said of the Obama administration. These were academics, intellectuals, and technocrats who were not only very smart they took pride in being practical, grounded in reality, and wedded to facts. After the supposed   and ideological rigidity of the George W. Bush administration, many of us welcomed the prospect of a president who was cerebral and professorial. Even those sympathetic to President Barack Obama’s   instincts, however, will agree that it didn’t quite go as planned. The Obama Doctrine, The very notion of “facts” has been demeaned by Republicans, and most of all by Team Donald Trump. As Trump surrogate Scottie Nell Hughes put it, “There’s no such thing, unfortunately anymore, as facts. ” In response, Democrats have doubled down on their tendency to wield facts as cudgels, demonstrating their righteousness in the process. It would be a loss, though, if this came to be seen as merely another partisan schism. As it turns out, Obama’s   legacy can offer an important window into whether facts —  and being “ ” —  are quite as critical to   policy success as we might like to think. Unlike Kennedy and Johnson, Obama was very much the    setting the tone for the people he would surround himself with. His intelligence was generally in little doubt. During his eight years in the Oval Office, the president was an almost unbelievably voracious reader, devoting around an hour on most days to books of history, philosophy, biography, or even   novels. But being smart and   doesn’t necessarily lead to good judgment or bold vision in some cases, even, the former can undermine the latter. “The best and the brightest” entered the American lexicon, with more than a hint of irony, through David Halberstam’s landmark book on the men who dragged America into the Vietnam War. In his foreword to the book, Senator John McCain writes of these men: “They misjudged the world. And, most of all, they misjudged themselves. ” Matters of judgment still loom large four decades later. I, or any critic of Obama’s foreign policy, could sit with an Obama administration official, and, even if we agreed on all the facts and specifics of a particular country or conflict, it wouldn’t matter much. Divergences in how people interpret Obama’s legacy have much more to do with fundamentally different starting assumptions about America’s role in the world and even human nature —  in other words, the very reasons why we do what we do. In fact, looking back at my own meetings with officials during the Obama era, rarely do I ever recall hearing something and thinking to myself that I had just heard some gross error of fact. This is why I found such meetings so frustrating and circular: The only things we disagreed on were the most important. For example, I have little disagreement with the technical aspects of the Iran nuclear deal. The problem, well before negotiations even started, was the initial decision to treat Iran’s nuclear program as the top U. S. priority in the Middle East. On Syria, opponents of intervention against the Assad regime would often claim that various military options were prohibitively difficult to implement, and that those who claimed otherwise weren’t military experts. Of course, Obama himself is not a military expert either. Either way, the claim was disingenuous: Senior military officials had readied a military response to Assad’s violation of the “red line” drawn over the use of chemical weapons in August 2013, and with no notable dissent. Ultimately, the divide over Syria was about deeper questions of moral responsibility, America’s role in the world, and whether an intervention would be “worth” the cost (something which, of course, can’t actually be measured). As Steven A. Cook wrote in early 2012 when only around 7, 000 people had been killed in Syria: “Is it a morally superior position to sit by as people are being killed rather than take action that will kill people, but nevertheless may end up saving lives as well?” It was Obama, at the 11th hour, who, coming to his own very personal answer, abruptly reversed course. This, like the decision to prioritize the Iran deal over all else, was no accident of history. There are, in fact, a set of basic, overarching ideas that appear to animate Obama and his most loyal aides, which come through in any number of interviews and profiles. They include what Nina Hachigian and David Shorr call the “responsibility doctrine” —  the idea that stepping back allows others to step in and take responsibility for their own region. In the Middle East, though, the success of such an approach depends on having allies that share American interests or American values, when, in reality, most share little of either. Due to the formative experience of the Iraq war, as well as domestic political considerations, Obama hoped to reduce America’s footprint in the Middle East. This meant a general bias toward disengagement, irrespective of whether greater U. S. involvement could produce better outcomes in particular crises (even the Iran nuclear deal was basically about removing the possibility of an American war with Iran). There was also a general discomfort around the direct use of U. S. military force, a discomfort which was as ideological as it was practical. These starting assumptions seemed colored as much by objective assessments of fact as by Obama’s distinctive —  and seemingly   —  perspectives around human nature. As Michiko Kakutani notes, Obama has thought deeply about these things: “During [Obama’s] last two years in college, he spent a focused period of deep   and study, methodically reading philosophers from St. Augustine to Nietzsche, Emerson to Sartre to Niebuhr, to strip down and test his own beliefs. ” Some of these views are just as applicable to domestic issues as they are to foreign policy. In   Coates’s profile of Barack Obama’s evolution on race, there are a number of recurring themes: a   optimism that makes it more difficult to process defeats, or, for that matter, evil and a set of assumptions about the inherent rightness and rationality of the American people, including his adversaries. As Coates writes, Obama, who experienced relatively little direct racism in his own life, “appealed to a belief in innocence —  in particular a white innocence —  that ascribed the country’s historical errors more to misunderstanding and the work of a small cabal than to any deliberate malevolence or widespread racism. ” Evil, then, was something outside of history, a history which, Obama liked to remind people, bended toward justice. Obama often seemed annoyed with others’ resistance to this march of historical progress. He wanted others, friends and enemies alike, to act rationally in what he thought was their own interest: Iran, after a deal, would be more likely to play a constructive regional role Israeli leaders didn’t realize that the Iran nuclear deal was in their own interest, but they’d surely come around Russia, after aggressively intervening in Syria, would soon come to see the error of its ways (“I think Mr. Putin understands that   …     with Afghanistan fresh in the memory, for him to simply get bogged down in an inconclusive and paralyzing civil conflict is not the outcome that he’s looking for,” Obama commented). President Obama also disparaged Arab “tribalism,” a   word that captured not just his impatience with tribalism, narrowly understood, but the uncontrolled passions of ideology, identity, and religious fervor. “If only everyone could be like the Scandinavians, this would all be easy,” Obama was known to say to aides. But no one, apparently even Scandinavians, could be like the Scandinavians. Obama’s cool rationalism and emotional remove could easily devolve into disdain, whether disdain toward Middle Eastern allies or disdain toward Donald Trump and his electoral prospects. As his tenure wound down, Obama seemed as resistant as ever to adapting his views, despite everything that had happened under his watch, whether at home or abroad. The president believed that history moved with him, but in an era of resurgent ideology and nationalism, he was the one who increasingly seemed like an outlier, out of place and out of time."
53375,73577,Nintendo Wants Players to Look at Each Other Again,Atlantic,Jon Irwin,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0,,"A father and son stand facing one another, hands at their sides, five feet apart. Each holds a small Nintendo controller in his palm. Right now, that controller is a firearm. Later it will be a samurai sword, a   paddle, or a cow’s udder. The son looks at the large television to his left. “Don’t look at the TV,” a Nintendo employee says. “Look at him,” he says, gesturing to the son’s father. “Look into his eyes. ” The son, about 9 years old, looks up. His father towers over him, but the child’s gaze is steady. Each waits for the game’s single instruction. Dad’s mouth purses. Junior’s arm begins to shudder. The Nintendo employee’s bright red shirt is a looming sunset in the gunslingers’ periphery. Then: “Fire!” The child flings his arm up and hits the trigger button on the controller’s undercarriage. The father, slow on the draw, brings up his arm but knows he’s too late. The TV shows two   cowboys, real people dressed in Western regalia the one on the right falls over, his knees buckling. The son was faster on this day. His dad clutches his chest in mock pain. The son laughs. His eyes are wide open. * * * Last week, Nintendo revealed their latest   console, the Nintendo Switch, which it will ship worldwide on March 3. The concept: a home system you can play anywhere. Plug the   device into a TV to play traditional games on the couch. Then take the same device on the road, to play in the car, on a plane, or in the park on the console’s own   HD display. While tablets like the iPad or Kindle are all screen, the Switch comes with two detachable controllers that bookend the system. Slide them on and it becomes a handheld game machine. Slide them off and each becomes its own controller, allowing play with a friend. Fold out a kickstand from the back of the system to set it on a table, and both players can look at the screen on a desk or an airline  . But Nintendo hopes players look elsewhere. Not at their 4K televisions, or at the Switch’s display. They want people to play video games by looking directly into the eyes of another human. During a   presentation in Tokyo, the company showed off the concept via a title called   . The software asks the player to ignore the screen and focus on their opponent. Among the collection of challenges is “Quick Draw,” a   duel. At a media event the following day in Manhattan, I watched as that child shot his dad dead using fast reflexes, a steely glare, and a bit of imagination. But I didn’t understand why this might be appealing until I tried it myself. I played against a local man I’d just met, named Ryan. Each of us held one of the two controllers —  Nintendo is calling them “” and they feel like smaller, curvier Wii Remotes, controllers from a previous Nintendo console. Seconds after meeting this stranger we were staring deeply into each other’s eyes. I realized then I almost never play video games that make you look directly at your opponents. Actually, I rarely look directly at people at all for an extended period —  let alone strangers. It was thrilling. We hammed it up. We sought dominance through arched eyebrows, found advantage in a widened iris or a furtive glance. The software takes pains to distract from the screen. When “Quick Draw” begins, a   John Wayne soundalike calls out in a smooth drawl, “Face each other. ” If you peek at the screen you’ll find it covered with a thick banner admonishing you in text: “Look each other in the eye!” And so you do. What it and the other games in    require —  speedy reactions for a duel, consistent timing in     rhythmic squeezing while milking a cow —  is almost secondary to the drama playing out under your opponent’s eyelids. Ryan’s eyes were intense, but playfully so. After each round the surrounding skin would crinkle this was all a   that rare chance to strike innocent fear in another through   intimidation.    is Wii Sports with Eye Contact. If that sounds unappealing, consider the modest games of playgrounds and school buses. Blacktops are littered with kids testing their interpersonal boundaries under the guise of play. First one to blink loses. Two for flinching. “Honey if you love me. ” Not to mention traditional,    sports like tennis, boxing, and judo. Facing one’s opponent isn’t new to games so much as to video games, which largely have remained moored to the screen. * * * But not entirely. Over the last decade, a series of experimental and independent game makers have tried to bridge the digital and physical worlds more seamlessly. Most of these titles are prototypes or art projects, shown as part of public exhibitions or featured at conferences like alt. ctrl. gdc, a sideshow of the annual Game Developer’s Conference. They often use bespoke controllers, like Frank DeMarco’s Planet Licker, in which players touch ice balls with their tongues to move an alien through space. But even that one requires a screen to view the cosmos. One of the most successful   games is Johann Sebastian Joust, by Die Gute Fabrik, a collective of developers out of Copenhagen and New York. The game uses PlayStation Move controllers —  like a Wii Remote with a     ball on top —  for an exercise in public trust. No screens are needed, just a group of willing participants. While listening to one of Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos, players attempt to jostle opponents’ controllers out of their hands while protecting their own. The speed of the music determines the controllers’ sensitivity, giving the match an ebb and flow of static anticipation and feverish mania. The result is a mix of mime, fencing,   musical chairs, and  . Douglas Wilson, one of Johann Sebastian Joust’s creators, tells me that losing the traditional visuals widened his audience: “Ditching the screen altogether is a nice trick for attracting a broader variety of players. I think that sometimes when   see graphics on a screen, they think: ‘Oh, video games. They aren’t for me. ’” Wilson’s insight helps explain Nintendo’s   adoption of similar designs. Contra Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has attempted to attract the widest possible audience for years. They first used a   screen to offer simple   gameplay on their 2004 DS handheld. Two years later, the Wii used motion control to enthrall kids and retirees alike. If Wilson is right,    represents a refining of that philosophy down to the marrow. Strange as it may seem for a   company, Nintendo has always been suspicious of the television. In a 2012 interview with The New York Times, Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario and one of the most famous game developers in the world, spoke of this surprising animosity. “For many years I have said that traditional game systems are too reliant on the television,” Miyamoto said, adding, “or are even a parasite on the television. ” When Nintendo’s former president Satoru Iwata announced that the company would release software on smartphones for the first time, he reluctantly copped to that device’s popularity. “Smart devices have grown to become the window for so many people to personally connect with society,” Iwata said, calling it a “waste” not to use them for games. And use them they have: “Super Mario Run” has been downloaded more than 90 million times since its release on the App Store last month. But it’s easy to wonder if Nintendo’s heart isn’t really in smartphones. With the Switch, the company hopes to tap into another window. The one into our souls. * * * This is not a new development. For decades before Mario, Nintendo forged    connections between players, without any screens at all. Upon its founding in 1889, Nintendo was a   company. These hanafuda cards were often used in gambling circles. More than the cards themselves, each game played out on the faces around the table. The new system clearly inherits this lineage. In the 1960s and ’70s, Nintendo designed novelty toys, among them a “Light Telephone” that transported sound waves over beams of light. Once more, the two users had to be facing one another with nothing in between each light source. But it worked surprisingly well, enough that Popular Science wrote about the device in 1971, though it never reached the West. In 1976, 30 years before the Wii, Nintendo released Custom Gunman. A plastic cowboy stood on a stand, holding his   out in front of him. Over his heart was a photovoltaic cell, normally used in solar panels. Its inventor, Gunpei Yokoi, used it as a target sensor. Fire the toy gun, and if the cell “sees” the light that shines from it, the sensor reacts and the cowboy’s articulated knees buckle, making him fall. When Ryan and I pulled our   triggers, it was as if that toy cowboy from long ago was finally getting his revenge. Now the   can fire back. Not all of the games for Nintendo Switch will hinge on eye contact. Many are traditional video games played using joysticks and buttons while staring at a screen. But first impressions are important: That    was the first game shown during Nintendo’s unveiling is telling of their motives. Instead of just building bigger and grander illusions through which to wander   they’re reminding us that magic happens in front of our eyes, all the time. Behind the eyes of my opponent Ryan was an accumulation of memories and heartbreaks, triumphs and regret. It’s not that I could see them through a simple video game, but that I couldn’t deny that he was human and had lived. That is no small thing. Billions of dollars and thousands of hours have been spent trying to electronically fabricate what humans inherently possess. Nintendo is doing what they always do: use existing material in new ways. Yokoi, who invented many of Nintendo’s early toys and is credited with the creation of the Game Boy, called this philosophy “lateral thinking with seasoned technology. ” Only this time, the players themselves are the technology. * * * Compare    play with the gaming industry’s latest trend: Virtual Reality. VR experiences require players to do the opposite: to cover their eyes with an opaque visor. Last year, the Taiwanese phone manufacturer HTC,   Oculus, and Sony all released VR headsets to wide acclaim, millions of investment dollars —  and lukewarm sales so far. All require expensive hardware and complex  . Certain games require flanking an entire room with light sensors. To some, the end result is stunning, a new form of immersive entertainment. Others have balked at the price, or felt  . With the Switch, Nintendo is offering a very different proposition. The question is, will players be receptive to Nintendo’s more intimate requirements? In On Photography, Susan Sontag writes, “all borders   …     seem arbitrary. Anything can be separated, can be made discontinuous, from anything else: All that is necessary is to frame the subject differently. ” A television is one kind of frame. So is a  ’s bezel. What happens when the frame is a human face? Before stepping into my demo of    I felt some food stuck in my teeth. I went to dislodge the crumb but thought better of it whatever was lodged between incisors might prove distracting to my opponent. Suddenly the mere sight of me held weight in a game world, precisely because that game’s world was also my own. That impression was empowering, but also disquieting. Why does staring into a stranger’s eyes feel so unnerving? Why do we instinctively look away? Most who play    will likely gaze upon a friend or loved one. But maybe that’s worse. One role video games play is helping people avoid the awkwardness of    interaction, or to mediate that interaction through an external challenge. Do players really want to reveal their souls through games —  or to see others revealed? Nintendo is placing a risky bet. They are hoping consumers will be willing to shell out $299. 99 (for the system) and $49. 95 (for the game) for a chance to encounter their own frailties. Their last venture this bold, the 2006 Wii, moved in the opposite direction, minimizing players’ fragile physical esteem by giving them a shortcut to athletic prowess: Wiggle this wand to swing a sword or serve an ace. The result enjoyed a mass market enthusiasm no   system has seen prior or since, selling more than 100 million units worldwide. But the company’s   the Wii U, has sold just over 13 million units, making it their   home system ever. Nintendo needs a hit. Asking people to ignore their screens and stare at each other might not become that sensation. But Nintendo has surprised people before. Their imminent demise is predicted on a   basis. Still, one can’t help but see Nintendo showing its own belly with the design of the Switch. Staring its own players down in order to uncover something about its long past and true nature. Will they accept the invitation to see it, or will they blink and glance away?"
53376,73578,Two Cases Could Limit or Enhance Trump’s Ability to Engage in Mass Deportations ,Atlantic,Garrett Epps,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0,,"The Supreme Court sometimes seems like Plato’s cave —  a place where events of the outside world cast only faint and distorted shadows. Nonetheless, no justice of the Court since at least John Marshall has taken the bench without a lively appreciation of presidential politics. Without it, you just don’t get there. What Happens When a President Is Declared Illegitimate? So what do the four conservative justices think of America’s  ? At least some of them seem like highly principled conservatives —  and the new leader of their party is neither. He seems to many instead like a cross between Huey Long and Uzbekistan’s late dictator Ismail Karimov, a blustering tyrant determined to govern by a Tweet of iron. Do they worry about the hands that will soon control the fearsome mechanism of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and its parent Department of Homeland Security, as well as the F. B. I. and the Bureau of Prisons? Does the prospect alarm them? As the University of Texas’s Stephen Vladeck explained recently in Just Security, this Term is likely to be quite consequential for the ways in which the United States treats   within its borders. Some of these cases may carry a hint of the unspoken reaction of the Court’s right bench. The first case, Jennings v. Rodriguez, concerns whether aliens being detained pending deportation are entitled to a bail hearing and to release while their cases (or their appeals) are pending. The second, Ashcroft v. Abbasi, asks whether official immunity would shelter a government policy of detaining aliens in abusive or   conditions —  making them so miserable that they will go on their own. Let’s remember the vast scale of what the new administration proposes to do in the immigration area. On November 13 of last year, The New York Times ran a headline saying “Donald Trump Appears to Soften Stance on Immigration. ” This “softer” position, God save the mark, is a mere threat to deport 2 to 3 million human beings —  more people than live in any one of at least 14 American states. Many of them will have families and ties to their community. This is not “softness” —  indeed, it skirts criminality. Deportation on this scale —  especially when targeted at certain national origins or ethnicities —   —  risks being considered “forcible population transfer” —  an emerging crime in international   law. Couple this dangerous scale with the issue of what will happen to these people before they are deported. The tastefully named “Operation Wetback” in 1954 was the last mass deportation scheme in U. S. history Trump has praised it as an example to be followed. It led to the forced deportation, with little or no due process, of as many as 1. 5 million Mexican citizens in the U. S. —  and even to many U. S. citizens of Latino origin being rounded up and marched across the border for the “offense” of not carrying their birth certificates. Some detained Mexicans and Mexican Americans were held at crude detention camps in the desert others were dropped off near the border and left to find their own way “home. ” A massive deportation today would require similar logistics —  buses or trainloads full of prisoners, camps (perhaps, the government has hinted, on abandoned Army bases). And once prisoners were there, the government would face a dilemma. Because the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause applies to all “persons” in the United States. The Supreme Court has repeatedly warned that “aliens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law. ”    The process they get can be pretty sketchy. Some categories of aliens —  those arrested near the border without documents, those who have been removed before, or those convicted of “aggravated felonies” —  are subject to a set of procedures that Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia of Pennsylvania State University Law School has christened “speed deportation. ” In theory, these processes can be completed in days or weeks. Others, by statute, are entitled to a full hearing in front of an immigration judge and an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Those courts have already buckled under the flow of cases spurred by the Obama Administration’s policies, with immigrants waiting a year or more for hearing dates.  Quintupling the caseload will guarantee make that worse. Even the “speed deportation” candidates, however, are at least formally entitled to something more than quick bus ride to the border. Aliens arrested as “removable” may actually have claims to bar removal. Some (as noted above) may actually be U. S. citizens or lawful residents. Others may be candidates for political asylum (genuine asylees by law cannot be returned to their countries of origin). Some may have been detained because of a confusion of identity. Some may have other equitable reasons that would lead the government to allow them to stay.  They must have a chance to contest the alleged grounds for removal, and a request of some kind for judicial review. But many do not seek their rights. They may not know about them they have no right to counsel —  or they may find the conditions of detention unbearable. They can be offered the alternative of something something called “voluntary departure. ” Under this heading, aliens agree to leave and pay their own way home. The “advantage” is that an alien who accepts it won’t be detained, and remains at least formally qualified to   illegally. In practice, says my colleague Elizabeth Keyes of the University of Baltimore law school, “voluntary departure has been a bad deal” since it first began to be offered. A person who has departed voluntarily may not apply to come back for at least ten years, and may be subject to exclusion when he or she finally can apply. Voluntary departure, however, is great for the government. Aliens might more easily be persuaded to take it if they can be kept in isolated detention compounds, far from family, community members, and potential counsel —  and possibly subject to mistreatment by the jailers. Jennings, the first case, now poses the question whether the government can hold people awaiting deportation indefinitely, pending hearings. Two Circuits —  the Ninth and the Second —  have held that aliens are entitled to a bail hearing and to release while their cases or appeals are pending. They based this holding on statutory language —  but that is at best (for the aliens’ point of view) unclear after hearing an argument about the statute, the Court issued an unusual order on December 15 directing the parties to brief the constitutional issue. Can the government hold aliens indefinitely if they are potentially deportable? For that matter, can it hold anyone indefinitely when the person is not charged with a crime? (Watch the space below for outraged comments that just being unlawfully present in the U. S. is a crime. Two things: (1) It isn’t and (2) the aliens are awaiting a civil proceeding, not a criminal trial. If they were charged with a crime, they would have a lot more, not fewer, rights —  including a right to counsel and often a right to a bail hearing.) The constitutional issue is made more portentous by the fact that a Republican Congress could decide to pass legislation stripping statutory guarantees above from some or all of the undocumented who fall into the icy hands of Homeland Security. But it can’t repeal the Constitution. The answer to that question may mean a lot when the tumbrils of the “deportation task force” begin to roll. Immigration law already gives ICE wide powers over people who fall into its maw will there be an appetite to give it more? The second question is whether the government can make detention so miserable that aliens will go on their own? That issue is implicated by a case to be heard Wednesday. Ashcroft is actually three cases all arising out of the hasty    roundup of “suspicious” seeming aliens in the New York area. These former detainees are suing the high officials —  such as former Attorney General John Ashcroft —  who oversaw the “hold until cleared” policy. Under this program, aliens who were grabbed (often off the street, for offenses like taking photographs) were held until the FBI satisfied itself they were no threat. Two reports by the Department of Justice itself have established beyond question that the aliens were held under brutal conditions and subjected to discriminatory treatment by officers at the federal detention center. (One, for example, was held in solitary and subject to such harassment that he could not be transferred to the general population because he was “was crying too much. ”) After thirteen years of bouncing around (under various names) in the lower courts, the plaintiffs won a preliminary victory in the Second Circuit. That court held that their complaint against the high officials could go to a full trial under a federal case called Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. That case permits lawsuits against federal officials who violate “clearly established” rights. The Court has, over the years, narrowed the availability of Bivens, expanding the official immunity of federal actors. Most handicappers regard victory for the aliens as unlikely —  especially since two of the Court’s   Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan, are recusing (apparently) because they had some contact with the case before they came on the Court. So a   victory for the government is likely. But is there a single conservative justice who may be able to imagine what indefinite detention, and expanded immunity, could mean in conjunction with a new administration committed to a new version of Operation Wetback —   —  or even the Japanese Internment? Might such a justice write an opinion qualifying the result? Or is it business as usual at First St. NE, even as the sky falls everywhere else?"
53377,73579,What Betsy DeVos Did (and Didn’t) Reveal About Her Education Priorities,Atlantic,Emily DeRuy,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"Donald Trump advocated on the campaign trail for a $20 billion federal   program. But during her confirmation hearing on Tuesday evening, Betsy DeVos, the  ’s choice to lead the U. S. Education Department, said school choice should be a state decision. She framed school choice as a right for students and families. And she said during the hearing that she was committed to strengthening public education for all students. While the Michigan billionaire has backed charter schools and vouchers, which let families use public money to pay for private schools, DeVos would not, she said, try to force states to embrace school choice. But a number of organizations, largely Democratic, that had raised questions about DeVos’s commitment to expanding charters and vouchers and about her family’s financial holdings and religious causes were unlikely to find much more of the hearing reassuring. 5 Things to Know About Betsy DeVos, Trump’s Pick for Education Secretary  Throughout the    exchange between DeVos and members of the Senate’s Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, DeVos —  who has never taught public school, never attended public school, and never held elected office —  sidestepped questions about everything from how she will ensure that groups she has backed financially in the past will not feel pressure to behave a certain way to whether guns belong in schools. At one point, she seemed to suggest that a federal law governing how students with disabilities are educated could be left to states, prompting Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan to express concern about her grasp of the department’s obligations. Noticeably absent from the hearing were substantive discussions of the Common Core standards, which Trump has lambasted how DeVos would handle racial inequity and school segregation, which have been priorities of the Obama administration and issues around standardized testing, accreditation, and   schools. She offered little clarity around her views on higher education and   education, broadly. But she did push back at the idea that college is the only pathway to success, and indicated that she would support vocational schools and   programs —  a nod to Trump’s voter base. The evasion tactics (which nominees of both parties have employed for as long as confirmation hearings have been a thing) left Democratic members of the committee calling for more hearings. The convening was more intense than most hearings in recent memory involving nominees for education secretary in part because DeVos is an unusual nominee. She and her family have vast financial holdings, and she is the first of Trump’s nominees to go through the hearing process without a signed ethics agreement in place for how she plans to resolve any conflicts of interest. While the prominent Republican donor faced critical questions about those holdings and other education issues from senators such as Elizabeth Warren and Tim Kaine, she also received praise from Republicans, such as from the former education secretary Senator Lamar Alexander, who think Washington has overstepped its reach on education under the Obama administration. “She is and has been on our childrens’ side,” he said. * * * In the weeks leading up to the hearing, a number of prominent Republicans, including former presidential contenders Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, came out in support of DeVos’s work to support school choice. But   groups and teachers’ unions have challenged  what they see as her lack of experience in public education and her family’s ties to conservative religious organizations. Broadly, DeVos has fought to expand charter schools and the use of vouchers, including to pay for religious schools. DeVos has spoken in the past about advancing a Christian agenda through education. And critics are worried that her involvement with a variety of causes and lawmakers will complicate her ability to serve as secretary. According to the   Center for American Progress, DeVos’s family has given nearly $1 million to more than 20 senators who will vote on her confirmation, including roughly $250, 000 to members of the education committee. The family gave Senator Tim Scott, the Republican from South Carolina who introduced DeVos at the beginning of the hearing, nearly $50, 000, and he served as keynote speaker at last year’s annual summit for the American Federation for Children, an organization she chaired until recently. In a 1997   DeVos acknowledged that she expects to gain something from these contributions. “I have decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence,” she wrote.  “Now I simply concede the point. They are right. ” Some lawmakers have also raised concerns about her connections to certain industries she would oversee as secretary, among them student loans. As the Washington Post noted recently, DeVos has ties to a firm that loaned money to a   agency that did business with the U. S. Education Department. That agency, Performant Financial Corp. recently failed to win another bid with the department, but, as secretary, DeVos would be able to affect which companies win such contracts and how they are handled. DeVos said during the hearing she and her husband would distance themselves from such education investments. In her opening statement, DeVos said, “I share   Trump’s view that it’s time to shift the debate from what the system thinks is best for kids to what moms and dads want, expect and deserve. ” She spoke of a visit when her oldest child was young to a Christian school serving   children, where she “saw the struggles and sacrifices many of these families faced when trying to choose the best educational option for their children. ” That experience, she said, helped spark a commitment to school choice. That’s a record that has won her favor not only with many Republicans, but with a few Democrats, too. Anthony Williams, the former mayor of Washington, D. C. and a Democrat, praised DeVos’s support of vouchers. The city has the country’s only federally funded voucher program, which Williams backed. And she was introduced by the former Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat who later became an independent. Lieberman sits on the board of the American Federation for Children, which DeVos chaired until recently. Yet according to a 2015   poll, most Americans favor the idea of charter schools, but less than a third support the concept of vouchers. Many economists also question the idea of privatizing the U. S. education system. As Susan Dynarski, a professor of education, public policy, and economics at the University of Michigan noted in the New York Times recently, a panel of economists who generally support a   approach to things like ride sharing was not inclined to support the use of vouchers. In some cases, she writes, charter schools (publicly funded but privately run) that are closely overseen can create healthy competition for traditional public schools. But critics have pointed out that Michigan, where DeVos has concentrated many of her efforts, has some of the     charter schools in the country. Senator Alexander, who chairs the committee, said it would meet early next week to consider DeVos’s nomination, provided her agreement with the ethics office is in place by Friday."

The delay has caused consternation among interest groups and may illustrate the challenges Trump will face while reconciling his campaign promises with    governance. Meanwhile, confirmation hearings for the other nominees continue, with Education Secretary pick Betsy DeVos testifying this evening. As a former lobbyist, she’s made a career of advocating for vouchers and charter schools —  but now, like Trump, she’ll have to translate her strong views into effective policy. Read all our updates on the hearings here. Health Care: For now, it looks like the Trump administration’s most immediate policy challenge will be replacing Obamacare, after GOP legislators cleared the way to repeal the law on Friday. Paradoxically, the voters given most credit for supporting Trump —  the older white working class —  may be among the Americans most at risk from the law’s repeal, which places their Republican representatives in a tricky position. Meanwhile, scrapping the law will likely have big economic consequences —  particularly for women, thousands of whom are more financially secure as a result of Obamacare coverage. But Obama isn’t the only president whose   legacy may be in doubt Trump’s team has considered scrapping PEPFAR, George W. Bush’s highly successful program for AIDS relief in Africa —  a move that could have tragic and devastating consequences. As for Foreign Policy: The   made some European leaders uneasy this weekend when, in a joint interview with The Times of London and the German tabloid Bild, he called NATO “obsolete” and doubted the future of the EU. He cited immigration and refugee policy as his main reason for predicting that other countries would soon follow Britain in exiting the union. For her part, British Prime Minister Theresa May today offered her clearest outline yet of what a   Europe will look like, emphasizing British control of immigration from Europe and free trade between the U. K. and EU member states. John Dean, who served as White House counsel under Richard Nixon, shares his fears for Trump’s presidency: “He is going to test our democracy as it has never been tested. ” Wole Soyinka, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, shares why he’s returning to Nigeria from the U. S. in the aftermath of Trump’s election. Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, explains how states can protect workers’ interests —  even if the federal government won’t. Brit Marling,   and star of the   series The OA, discusses the inspiration for the show, which ranges from French folklore to the Russian punk band Pussy Riot. Mark Galeotti on the FSB, Russia’s infamous political police force: Originally established to protect the Kremlin’s rule at home, it has increasingly moved into Russia’s foreign operations. A new cohort of secret policemen, ignorant of the traditions of spycraft and secure in Putin’s protection, has fundamentally altered the nature of Russian intelligence.   …     By allowing the FSB to move into foreign intelligence and covert operations, though, Putin has —  probably inadvertently —  unleashed a beast. The FSB is playing a central role in current developments not because it possesses greater technical capabilities than the other Russian agencies, but because, for the most part, it does not recognize or respect the same limitations as the rest of Russia’s security services. To put it crudely, the FSB does the kinds of things everyone else thinks about doing but doesn’t because they’re too risky, too politically inflammatory, or too likely to backfire. Keep reading here, as Galeotti traces the FSB’s rise to power. These days, though, you don’t have to be a powerful spy agency to learn people’s personal info.

We decided to have children, and, as lesbians, were sent directly to a reproductive endocrinologist. We kept trying to tell the doctors and nurses (and each other) that we weren’t infertile . .. we just didn’t have sperm! Except it appears we are somewhat infertile. After four failed IUI cycles using my uterus and donor sperm, we reached the point at which we were told, “If it was going to happen this way, it would have already. ” Our 20 percent chance was knocked down to 10 percent for further IUI, and they suggested IVF —  or, to change tracks and let my wife become pregnant. My wife is somewhat gender nonconforming, and her view of becoming pregnant herself is that she would do it if it were necessary for us to have a child —  something we both want. But she is uncomfortable with the idea of being pregnant.   …     Everyone says we’re lucky: We have two wombs, and sperm is inexpensive compared to surrogacy. [But] the choice isn’t that simple.

53379,73581,President Obama’s Last Clemency Push,Atlantic,Vann R. Newkirk II,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"In the waning hours of his presidency, Barack Obama used his clemency power to commute the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, a former U. S. Army analyst who was convicted of espionage in July 2013 by a military court after she turned over a massive cache of defense and diplomatic records, then the largest single leak in U. S. history, to the organization WikiLeaks. Among the materials released by Manning was a video recording showing Iraqi civilians being killed in a U. S. helicopter attack in Baghdad in 2007. According to a White House press release, along with abridging Manning’s   sentence to end in May of this year, President Obama granted 208 other commutations and 64 pardons Tuesday, thus closing a   scramble to reduce the federal prison population and establishing him as the most clement president in recent history. Obama has issued the most combined commutations and pardons of any president since Harry Truman, and more than Reagan, Clinton, and both Bushes combined. What Happens When a President Is Declared Illegitimate? Obama’s decision comes after a sustained campaign to free Manning, who has tried to commit suicide twice. Manning has been living in austere conditions as a transgender woman in a male military prison, and has faced extended periods of solitary confinement deemed by a UN special rapporteur on torture as tantamount to torture. Obama has been under growing pressure from human rights activists to commute the sentence of Manning and her fellow leaker Edward Snowden, who disclosed information on a number of surveillance programs in 2013, on the grounds that their actions served the public interest. The administration warmed to clemency for Manning, but not for Snowden, who fled the country to Russia and has not been tried in a U. S. court. Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, immediately condemned Obama’s decision to commute Manning’s sentence, saying her actions “put American lives at risk. ” Although Manning is the   name among the clemency list issued by the White House, there are a few more prominent names. Retired Marine General James Cartwright, who leaked information to New York Times reporters about the classified Stuxnet computer worm, which was used to hamper Iran’s nuclear weapons program, and admitted to lying about the leaks to FBI investigators, was granted a pardon Tuesday. Oscar López Rivera, leader of the Puerto Rican independence group Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional, who was sentenced in 1981 for 55 years for sedition, received a full commutation. Rivera had previously rejected President Bill Clinton’s offer for partial commutation in 1999. Also on the commutation list is Dwight J. Loving, a former Army private whose death row sentence for the murders of two people in Fort Hood would have made him the first military execution in over 50 years. Loving’s sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Also notable are names not on the list. After a 2016 petition and campaign by activists, the Congressional Black Caucus, and his son, deceased   leader Marcus Garvey was not granted a posthumous pardon. Garvey, a     leader in the early 20th century, was surveilled by the federal government’s   domestic spying efforts on black activists, and eventually brought up on federal mail fraud charges by a young J. Edgar Hoover and others. The charges led to his deportation from the country. Leonard Peltier, a Native American activist facing two life sentences, and Mumia   a black nationalist from Philadelphia serving a life sentence, were also not granted commutations or pardons. Both men were convicted in the killings of   officers, but activists on their behalf contend their trials were tainted by racism and government subterfuge. The vast majority of the remaining names on the White House’s clemency list are ordinary offenders that fit within the administration’s guidelines for clemency action: those convicted of nonviolent drug offenses who were given stiff federal penalties under older drug laws. The list of commutations includes around 100 people given life sentences for drug distribution or possession, with a handful of those including violent offenses or possession of a firearm. Aside from the commutations, some convicted of   drug charges were pardoned —   —  unlike a commutation, a pardon wipes away   restrictions like being barred from voting or serving on a jury. It is this last group of people, in addition to the more famous names, that the Obama administration hopes will help define its record on clemency. Obama’s clemency initiative has now granted over 1, 300 commutations and pardons to mostly nonviolent  . In that initiative, the Justice Department completed the review of over 16, 000 petitions, and was pushed along by activists in several   organizations. Assuming no more   commutations or pardons, Obama’s efforts will fall short of their demands to issue clemency for over 2, 000 federal inmates. Obama’s clemency efforts —  along with a push to scale back private prisons —  signal an administration and country willing to dial back at least some of its commitments to mass incarceration made during the War on Drugs. Also, his commutations of Mannings’s and Cartwright’s sentences come as an acknowledgement the criticism over the administration’s record of expanding   surveillance powers and its aggressive prosecutions of leakers. But on Friday, Obama will be followed by a president in Donald Trump who has disavowed his clemency efforts, has pledged to ramp up commitments to federal detention of undocumented immigrants, and appears at the least unconcerned about the existing American domestic surveillance and   apparatuses. Legacy is a tricky thing."
53380,73582,"Trump’s Interests vs. America’s, Vornado Edition",Atlantic,Jeremy Venook,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"  Donald Trump’s promise to erect a big, beautiful wall between himself and his business lasted slightly more than 48 hours. Almost exactly two days after the January 11 press conference at which Trump announced plans purported to disentangle himself from his namesake business, the Huffington Post reported that the   had scheduled a meeting with Steven Roth. Roth, a fellow New   billionaire   developer, is in charge of Vornado Realty Trust, an investment firm that   two of Trump’s most valuable properties, one in Manhattan and one in San Francisco, and served as an economic adviser during the campaign. What Trump and Roth discussed at their meeting remains unknown, nor is it clear when exactly the meeting was scheduled. Regardless, that the meeting came directly on the heels of the press conference at which Trump and his lawyer laid out a plan supposedly meant to resolve conflicts of interest, throws the reality of the problems that come from having a businessman as president —  and one who seems completely uninterested in taking steps that would actually distance him from his business —  into sharp relief. Shortly thereafter, The Wall Street Journal reported that Roth may soon become involved with the Trump administration beyond just his   friendship and partnership with the  . Trump, it seems, will soon be naming Roth and Richard LeFrak, yet another New   billionaire   developer, to oversee a council of 15 to 20 builders and engineers who will be carrying out the  ’s $1 trillion infrastructure proposal, a situation which itself provides ripe opportunities for the pair to direct federal dollars toward projects from which they will financially benefit. This news comes on top of a December report in The Washington Post that Roth’s firm had put in a bid to rebuild the FBI’s headquarters, a deal that could be worth as much as $2 billion. In other words, Trump, mere days after promising to remove himself from his businesses, is instead ushering a longtime partner into his administration. The move could also end up providing yet another avenue by which Trump could enrich himself in office and by which others could attempt to curry favor. Whether or not he intended to do so, the  ’s decision to place Roth at the head of such a large pool of money sends a signal to other companies about the continued intermingling of his business and his presidency: that working with the Trump Organization can be a path to increased influence or even appointment. And though Trump claims that he will no longer be in involved in    operations, he will be actively profiting off from the company, meaning that he will be personally making money off of the attempts of others to gain influence over American public policy. The Background,   Donald Trump will not be taking necessary steps to resolve his conflicts of interest before he takes office. At his press conference on January 11 —  his first since June 2016 —  Trump and his lawyer Sheri Dillon laid out the plans that they claimed would resolve the questions about conflicts of interest that have dogged the   since he was elected. Instead, what they announced were piecemeal steps that, though designed and packaged to mitigate the appearance of conflicts of interest, do almost nothing to substantively address concerns that his business entanglements will undermine his ability to faithfully execute the office of the presidency. The first of these steps, presaged by numerous reports from both within and outside the Trump Organization and his transition team, was to relinquish his official leadership roles within his company. In his stead, Trump’s two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, will be running    operations with a longtime associate of their father’s, with what so far amounts to a   assurance that they will not discuss any aspect of the business with the  . As has been previously written numerous times, such an arrangement does nothing to actually mitigate conflicts of interest Trump’s relationship to his sons, who are members of his transition team, among his closest advisers, and, perhaps most importantly, his children, is far too close for their stated arrangement to qualify as a blind trust. Additionally, Dillon’s description of how Trump will divorce himself from knowledge of their dealings does little to resolve the overarching problem of his   knowledge of his empire. The president’s holdings both in the United States and around the world are vast and highly visible it is unreasonable to assert that reducing official reports to just the company’s overall profits and losses will prevent him from knowing if a policy or position will be beneficial to his company, a problem to which Dillon herself alluded by asserting that the   “can’t   he owns Trump Tower. ” Similarly, Trump intends to create two positions, one within the government and one within his company, to act as ethical watchdogs over his behavior. These roles offer little reassurance unless the   or someone on his team spells out a   way by which Trump will be held to these standards. In fact, arguably the only one of the many steps Trump and Dillon announced that will actually reduce the potential for conflicts of interest is their pledge that the Trump Organization would be pursuing no new foreign deals while Trump is in office and, according to a press release from Trump’s law firm released after the conference, will terminate several deals that are currently underway. However, considering that Trump had previously promised no new deals, period, and considering the numerous properties around the world he will still own, the promise does little to assuage concerns that Trump’s business will influence his presidency. Dillon offered two preemptive defenses against the ethical and legal questions that Trump is likely to take once he takes office. The first is a reading of the   Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which makes it illegal for federal officeholders to “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign state. ” According to Dillon, agents of foreign governments staying at Trump hotels do not violate this clause because it does not apply to “  exchanges,” and “no one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. ” This, it should be said, is a minority position. Numerous experts, most notably Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics lawyers for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, and the constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe, have already voiced their disagreements in no uncertain terms, stating without reservation that Trump’s continued ownership of his properties will violate the Constitution the day he enters office. Moreover, the workaround Trump’s legal team has apparently created —  donating profits from foreign governments’ payments to the U. S. Treasury —  does nothing to change the fact that governments will likely attempt to curry favor with the president through his hotel, as he may view that as flattering, not to mention the hotel will still collect revenues on the stay. Their second defense was one that Trump has repeatedly asserted since the election: The law barring   officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties does not apply to the president or vice president. In this regard, they are correct the law, passed in 1989, exempts the two chief executives from    rules on the understanding that their purview is so broad that it would be almost impossible for them to completely disentangle themselves. Regardless, legality does not imply propriety. Unless Trump acts to put actual distance between himself and his business ventures —  and today’s press conference seems to indicate that he won’t —  these questions will likely continue throughout his time in the Oval Office. Already, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Michael Shaub, has declared Trump’s plans insufficient, remarking, “I don’t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States,” and a number of Senate Democrats have introduced legislation that would force Trump to divest or face impeachment. Below is an attempt to catalogue the more   examples of conflicts of interest that have emerged so far the most recent entries appear at the top. Those Indonesian Politicians, Despite   Donald Trump’s assurance that he has stopped pursuing deals since the election, his namesake organization apparently moved forward with a pair of projects in Indonesia. According to The New York Times, the two properties that will bear the Trump name, one overlooking a Hindu temple in Bali and the other abutting a theme park in West Java, presented ethical problems even before the election. To begin with, through his Indonesian partner on the projects, the billionaire media mogul Hary Tanoesoedibjo (known in Indonesia as Hary Tanoe) Trump has forged relationships with several top Indonesian politicians. One such leader is Setya Novanto, the speaker of the country’s House of Representatives who temporarily lost his post for trying to extort $4 billion from the American mining company   (a company which counts Carl Icahn, who will be serving as a special adviser in Trump’s administration, among its largest shareholders, and which has been frequently criticized by labor advocates and environmentalists). Trump had lunch with Novanto and several other Indonesian politicians during the campaign in September 2015 to discuss the Trump Organization’s planned expansion into Indonesia. At a   press conference, Trump pulled Novanto in front of the cameras, calling him “an amazing man” and “one of the most powerful men” and asserting, “we will do great things for the United States. ” (It is unclear exactly whom Trump meant when he used the word “we. ”) Trump then asked Novanto to confirm that “they like me in Indonesia,” which Novanto did. Another of the politicians who attended the lunch with Trump is Fadli Zon, the vice chairman of Indonesia’s House of Representatives, whose district includes one of the cities in which one of the   properties will be built. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Zon is associated with a political movement seeking to unseat and jail the current governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known by his nickname, Ahok, and has spoken at rallies against Ahok. The   movement is rooted partly in centuries of ethnic tension within the country: Ahok is both Christian, which has made him the target of attacks by hardline clerics claiming to represent Indonesia’s Muslim majority, and a member of the country’s historically oppressed Chinese minority, which was the target of a massacre in 1998. Aside from an interim governor appointed half a century ago, Ahok is the first governor of Jakarta to fall into either category, and is currently on trial for blasphemy for allegedly insulting the Koran, although Ahok’s supporters claim that it is Ahok’s accusers who are guilty of blasphemy for denigrating Ahok’s Christianity. Both Trump’s question to Novanto and Zon’s presence at the meeting underscore another difficulty the   introduces into the United States’ relations with Indonesia. Indonesia is both the largest predominantly Muslim country in the world and the nation with the largest population of Muslims. Novanto received significant blowback for his statement that, yes, Indonesians do like Trump, because it turns out that, no, many Indonesians don’t like Trump, in large part because of his     proposal to ban Muslims from immigrating to the U. S. in fact, faced with mounting criticism, Novanto’s party apologized not only for Novanto’s statement but also for his mere attendance at the luncheon. Since Trump’s victory, both Novanto and Zon have stood up for the   arguing that Trump’s hardline stance toward Muslim immigration was merely campaign rhetoric and not actually reflective of the  ’s own beliefs, something Novanto claimed Trump personally assured him was the case. Regardless, it is clear that the Trump Organization’s planned expansion into Indonesia —  which, again, is the reason Trump met with Novanto and Zon in the first place —  could introduce major complications into the relationship between the   and the political leaders of the world’s largest Muslim country, not to mention a significant trade partner and an important ally in the South China Sea region. As if that weren’t enough, Tanoe himself has shown increasing interest in becoming involved in Indonesian politics. In 2014, Tanoe publicly supported the retired general Prabowo Subianto in the nation’s presidential election Subianto lost to the country’s current leader, Joko Widodo. Then, in 2015, he helped found a new political party, the United Indonesia Party, or Partai Perindo, which intends to field candidates for national office in the near future, including Tanoe himself: Shortly after The New York Times reported on the project, Tanoe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that, “If there is no one I can believe who can fix the problems of the country, I may try to run for president. ” If Tanoe does so, it will create the possibility that Trump will be dealing with a head of state with whom he has shared business interests, which, as Richard Painter told The New York Times, “makes it impossible to conduct diplomacy in an evenhanded manner” —  especially considering that, after Trump’s election, stock in Tanoe’s company rose significantly. Moreover, Tanoe, like Ahok, is both Christian and ethnically Chinese, which some insiders consider an obstacle to his electoral chances, although Tanoe argues that it is not Ahok’s religion but his lack of firm leadership that has led to the   protests against the governor. Nevertheless, if Tanoe does choose to run for office, it is difficult to see how his race, religion, and business partnership with a   many see as blatantly Islamophobic could do anything other than create further difficulties both within Indonesia and in the country’s relationship with the U. S.. Since Trump and his lawyer announced on January 11 that the company would be suspending its unfinished development projects and pursuing no new foreign deals, the current state and eventual fate of the projects in Indonesia are unclear. Regardless, they have already created a remarkably complicated situation among the   and politicians and businesspeople involved in the country’s political scandals and ethnic divisions, jeopardizing his ability to appropriately interact with the nation’s leadership.  Back to table of contents, That Emirati Businessman, Though the biggest controversy over the New Year’s Eve celebration at    Trump’s Florida estate, was apparently whether or not Joe Scarborough could accurately be described as having “partied” there, video footage taken by a guest and obtained by CNN the next day brought renewed scrutiny to   Donald Trump’s own presence at the event. During a   speech given in front of the party’s   attendees, Trump praised his Emirati business partner Hussain Sajwani and Sajwani’s family, saying, “The most beautiful people from Dubai are here tonight, and they’re seeing it and they love it. ” CNN identifies Sajwani as a “billionaire developer in Dubai” who has “paid Trump millions of dollars to license the Trump name for golf courses in Dubai. ” Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, defended the remarks by clarifying that the   and Sajwani “had no formal meetings of professional discussions. Their interactions were social. ” Whether or not Hicks’s statement was true, Trump’s commendation of Sajwani is part of a pattern in which the   praises his business partners in ways that suggest he has little interest in extricating himself from his company’s interests. Previously, he has   business partners in Turkey and Argentina while on official calls with the countries’ leaders he also met, and took photos, with associates from India shortly after the election. Moreover, as with several of the countries in which   buildings are located, the United Arab Emirates has a questionable record on human rights Human Rights Watch specifically states that the nation “uses its affluence to mask the government’s   problems. ” By singling out Sajwani, Trump also runs headlong into accusations that he and his family are selling access to his administration through their organization and family foundations. According to Politico, tickets to celebrate with the   at    went for upwards of $500 the stated attendance of at least 800 people means that the Trump Organization made at least $400, 000 off of ticket sales for the event. (There is no indication that the party was a fundraiser for any outside organization, such as a charity or campaign fund, as is often the case when politicians attend such an event.) Whether or not the   sees it as such, the event offered attendees the opportunity to be in the same room as Trump and bend his ear for a price. This follows consternation regarding an auction for a    meeting with Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and a charity event that offered a reception with the   and a hunting trip with his two sons, both of which have since been cancelled, as well as ongoing speculation that foreign entities will attempt to curry favor with Trump by booking rooms and events at his hotel in Washington, D. C. That Trump singled out Sajwani at the New Year’s Eve party lends credence to these concerns —  it’s an instance of someone receiving the  ’s attention simply by buying a ticket to one of his events.  Back to table of contents, That Virginia Vineyard, Among the dozens of properties   Donald Trump owns is Trump Vineyard Estates and Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, the source of his namesake wine. Since Trump was elected, the property has requested temporary   visas for six foreign workers, according to The Washington Post. The visas, which are administered by the Citizenship and Immigration Services wing of the Department of Homeland Security, allow businesses to temporarily hire foreign, unskilled workers provided that the employer proves that there are not enough domestic candidates to fulfill a   or seasonal shortage and that the hiring will not depress wages for U. S.  employees. Trump, of course, will be in charge of appointing a new Secretary of Homeland Security once he assumes the presidency, which gives Trump authority over the very department responsible for deciding whether to grant the visas that the vineyard has requested. His current nominee, retired general John Kelly, has a relatively scant track record when it comes to immigration, leaving open the question of how much influence Trump himself will have over the DHS’s policy on the matter. On top of the fact that Trump will soon be able to influence the outcome of the request, that his organization has continued to request visas after his election underscores a tension in the  ’s stance on immigration. From the moment that he announced that he would be running for president, Trump made antagonism toward immigration the central aspect of his campaign, arguing that both legal and illegal immigrants are taking jobs that should be filled by   Americans and depressing wages for others. Though he did not specifically single out the   visa, the   has on multiple occasions spoken critically about the   program, which enables employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for skilled jobs like those in the tech industry. But the Trump Organization has long been a beneficiary of immigrant labor. For example, according to a Reuters report from August 2015, nine companies of which Trump is the majority owner have requested at least 1, 100 foreign visas since 2000. The majority of these requests were from Trump’s    Club in Florida, which has requested at least 787 foreign visas since 2006, including 70 applications in 2015. (Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that, since 2010, only 17 of the nearly 300 domestic applicants for positions at the    have been hired.) The Trump Organization also famously may have benefited from illegal immigration: There is significant evidence that many of the Polish construction workers at the Trump Tower construction site in New York in 1980 were in the country illegally. In other words, Trump’s track record includes not just taking advantage of the very visa process he claims to abhor but also actually subverting existing law for his own profit. Now, by applying for visas for his vineyard, Trump is signaling that he expects that his business will continue to be able to profit from one of the very immigration programs he continually denounces.  Back to table of contents, That Las Vegas Labor Dispute, On top of owning various properties and enterprises, Trump and his company employ roughly 34, 000 people, according to an analysis by CNN. On December 21, several hundred of those workers resolved  a labor dispute against the   —  one in which, had it continued for even a few weeks more, Trump would have had the unprecedented power to make appointments to affect its outcome. Here’s the situation: In October 2015, several hundred employees, primarily housekeeping staff, at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas voted to join the local branch of the Culinary Workers Union. Trump Ruffin Commercial LLC, which owns the hotel and is itself owned by Trump and the casino magnate Phil Ruffin, contested the vote, first by enlisting an   consulting firm (for whose services it paid $500, 000) and then by filing complaints with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Shortly before the election, the NLRB not only rejected Trump and Ruffin’s complaints but also found that, because the pair had refused to negotiate with the nascent union, they had violated federal law and their hotel was operating illegally. Trump and Ruffin have since appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On December 21, more than a year after the hotel’s workers first voted to join the union, the workers announced that they arrived at their first first   contract, achieved, according to an employee quoted in ThinkProgress, despite significant pressure from ownership that attempting to unionize would cost workers their jobs. According to the union, the new agreement “will provide the employees with annual wage increases, a pension, family health care, and job security” comparable to that of other Las Vegas hotels. Moreover, the Culinary Workers Union’s parent organization, UNITE HERE, has reached an agreement to represent workers at Trump’s   hotel in Washington, D. C.. Although this dispute has been resolved, it is included here because it exemplifies the type of situation in which Trump’s business interests are likely to overlap with his duties as president. Once he assumes office, Trump will be tasked with appointing members to fill current openings on the NLRB, the very body that ruled against him shortly before the election and will be tasked with resolving any future disputes between the hotel’s owners and its employees. Moreover, as Slate noted, the chief justice of the D. C. Court of Appeals is none other than Merrick Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court has spent months languishing in the   Congress and will likely be withdrawn once Trump becomes president. Finally, if disputes of this nature go beyond the Court of Appeals, the case would go to the Supreme Court, to which Trump will be appointing a justice once he assumes office, which is expected to tip the balance decisively in a more conservative (and likely  ) direction. In other words, no matter how far up the chain future disputes of this nature go, Trump’s presidency will give him new power to influence the results.  Back to table of contents, That Kuwaiti Event, According to an anonymous source and documents obtained by ThinkProgress, representatives from the Trump Organization pressured the ambassador of Kuwait to hold its embassy’s annual celebration of the country’s independence at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D. C. The event, held annually on February 25, was originally scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown the location was allegedly changed after members of the Trump Organization contacted the country’s ambassador. ThinkProgress’s source “described the decision as political,” suggesting that the embassy chose to relocate the event in an effort to curry favor with the  . The Kuwaiti ambassador has since disputed the report, telling The Washington Post that he had not been contacted by the Trump Organization and that the move “was solely done with the intention of providing our guests with a new venue. ” If ThinkProgress’s account is correct, Kuwait’s decision represents an escalation of a situation that has been developing since Trump’s election. The Trump International Hotel has been the subject of continual scrutiny for the conflict of interest it poses, in part because its lease explicitly bars elected officials from holding it, but mainly because Trump’s ownership of the hotel will almost definitely result in a violation of the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the president from receiving payments from foreign powers —  something that will arguably be happening any time a foreign government books a room at the hotel. Already, the hotel has begun advertising itself as a destination for diplomats and dignitaries, and the embassies of Azerbaijan and Bahrain have both scheduled events in the building. However, before the ThinkProgress report, there was no evidence that the Trump Organization had individually reached out to a foreign government in hopes of getting it to relocate an event to the hotel. Back to table of contents, Those Certificates of Divestiture, In addition to the many possibilities for   Trump to pursue his financial interests in office, the unique makeup of his cabinet also creates a new set of financial motivations. While Trump’s own fortune automatically makes his administration the wealthiest in history, he has also surrounded himself with an unprecedented collection of billionaires and   whose investments are likely to also come under scrutiny. Unlike the   himself, those who are up for Trump’s cabinet, such as his proposed Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, will be legally obligated to divest from any holdings which may pose a conflict of interest. However, as The Washington Post noted, even selling off their holdings offers an opportunity for Trump’s cabinet members to enhance their fortunes. A federal program known as a “certificate of divestiture” allows   appointees and employees to avoid   taxes when selling their assets. The program has existed since 1989, and most recently received attention when President George W. Bush appointed Hank Paulson, then the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as his Treasury Secretary in 2006. Paulson was forced to sell off $700 million in shares of the bank the certificate of divestiture enabled him to avoid a potential $200 million in   tax liability. According to The Washington Post, the Office of Government Ethics is currently researching whether the   himself would qualify for the tax break even if he doesn’t, the unprecedented wealth of Trump’s cabinet promises to push this provision, and the financial incentives it creates, to the limit. Back to table of contents, That Carrier Deal, One of   Donald Trump’s first major economic moves as   was the deal that he and Vice   Mike Pence struck with the   manufacturer Carrier, which had planned to move 2, 100 jobs from its Indiana plant to Mexico. Finalized on November 29, the compromise kept 730 of the plant’s jobs in Indiana in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks over 10 years. The deal immediately attracted praise and criticism on both sides of the aisle, with much of the scrutiny going toward the tradeoff between jobs and tax breaks and Trump’s idiosyncratic,   negotiation techniques. An additional detail soon emerged regarding the deal: According to his FEC filings (which, despite Trump and his spokesman Jason Miller’s unverified statements that the   sold off his stock in June, remain the most recent public record of the  ’s finances) Trump holds stock in Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies. In 2014, his investment in the company was between $100, 001 and $250, 000, while in 2015, the stock is listed as worth less than $1, 001, which could indicate that he sold some or most of the stock each year, his holdings earned him between $2, 500 and $5, 000. The paucity of information in the FEC filings makes it difficult to ascertain why his holdings appear to have decreased regardless, the investment is not only one of several hundred but also a relatively minor one among Trump’s many holdings, some of which are worth over $5, 000, 000. As a result, it’s difficult to know how much, if at all, Trump may have considered the stock, particularly considering that he didn’t appear to remember his initial promise to save the Carrier plant. Additionally, Trump does not have stock in the next company he called out on Twitter, Rexnord Corporation (which is also based in Indiana) or its parent company, The Carlyle Group. Still, Trump’s deal with Carrier demonstrates the unprecedented challenge the  ’s conflicts of interest create: Unless he either puts his holdings in a truly blind trust or divests completely, a significant number of the decisions he makes will involve some level of financial incentive for himself as well as for the country. Back to table of contents, That   Issue, Over the past few months, a number of experts have called for   Donald Trump to either sell off his business holdings or, if the illiquidity of his assets prevents him from doing so, to put as much as possible into a blind trust managed by a lawyer or other trustee with whom he will have no contact. Pursuing one of these two options is seen by many as an important step to distancing himself from even the appearance that he will be considering his own financial prospects in addition to those of the nation while in office. In response, Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he intends to cede control of his business to his three adult children, Donald Jr. Ivanka, and Eric, although, as has been previously noted, doing so would barely even create the appearance of a blind trust given how his children are close advisers, members of his transition team, and, well, his children. (Trump has also alluded on Twitter to an upcoming press conference in which he intends to more fully explain his plans, although doubts remain that the arrangement he proposes will actually create the necessary barriers between Trump and his business.) Moreover, even if one does take take the   at his word that his children will be entirely separate from his administration, events since his election strongly suggest otherwise. All three have been seen in contexts that significantly diminish the appearance of separation Roughly two weeks before the election, Donald Jr. met with a   group in Paris to discuss his father’s policy toward Syria and, according to Politico, was involved in his father’s search for a Secretary of the Interior he was also spotted hunting in Turkey shortly after his father’s phone call with Turkish President Recep Erdogan in which the   praised a Turkish business partner. Eric, meanwhile, appeared in photos with his father and a group of Indian businessmen mere days after the election. Officials within the State Department have begun to express frustration with the optics of the Trump family’s current system. Much of the focus, though, has been on Ivanka, whom many consider to be among her father’s most trusted advisers, and the various ways she has indicated that she will remain a part of both the family business and her father’s administration. Ivanka also appeared in the photos with the family’s Indian business partners, and she and her husband Jared Kushner —  also one of Trump’s advisers —  sat in on a meeting between the   and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reports later emerged that, at the time, Ivanka was in negotiation with the Japanese apparel company Sanei International, whose parent company is owned in large part by the Japanese government. A number of outlets have reported that, while Melania Trump will be the official First Lady, Ivanka plans to assume a policy portfolio akin to that of previous first ladies one issue she apparently plans to take on is climate change, on which she recently met with her father and former Vice President Al Gore. Even the optics of physical distance are diminishing: According to CNN, Ivanka and Jared plan to move from New York to Washington, D. C. once the Trump administration begins. That the  ’s children appear involved in both the Trump administration and the Trump Organization presents a major threat to the   norm that presidents should distance themselves from business interests that could interfere with their official duties. Finally, removing himself from    operations will do little to change the fact that Trump will retain substantive knowledge of the illiquid assets involved in his business, such as the numerous buildings and other products that bear his name, especially if he remains in frequent contact with his children. Even assuming that Trump does separate himself from any consideration of his holdings, his children will still likely be major players in the family’s organization, which will still bear at least the Trump name —  arguably one of their most valuable properties, as much of the family’s wealth derives from licensing the name to   companies. Given the family’s     (Ivanka, for example, briefly appeared to be distancing herself from the campaign, and several properties considered rebranding under the name “Scion” when it appeared Trump would lose) the situation epitomizes the way Trump’s, and his family’s, business interests may very well prove inextricable from his actions as president. Back to table of contents, Those Fannie and Freddie Investments, After railing against elites during the campaign, Trump has so far stocked his prospective cabinet with an array of billionaires whose policy positions seem likely to significantly benefit those who are also doing very well. Trump’s putative treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is no exception: His resume includes stints as a banker at Goldman Sachs, a Hollywood producer, and the operator of a bank that has been described as a “foreclosure machine” and once foreclosed on a homeowner over a   discrepancy. One of Mnuchin’s apparent beliefs is that the government should cede control of the mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government acquired during the 2008 financial crisis. The two financial institutions’ stocks rose by more than 40 percent after Mnuchin stated that he believes the Trump administration “will get it done reasonably fast. ” Doing so would be broadly compatible with Trump’s general antipathy toward regulation of the banking industry. However, The Wall Street Journal identified an additional wrinkle to the story: When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s stocks rose, one major beneficiary was John Paulson, an adviser to the Trump campaign and a business partner of Mnuchin’s. Paulson’s hedge funds include significant investments in both Fannie and Freddie. Trump himself has invested between $3 million and $5 million across three of Paulson’s funds, according to his filings with the Federal Election Commission (which remain the only available window into the  ’s financial holdings). In other words, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s stock prices increase —  and they have so far more than doubled since the election on the expectation that the incoming Trump administration will be more lenient toward the financial sector than Obama —  Trump’s portfolio benefits. Back to table of contents, That Phone Call With Taiwan, When news first emerged that the   spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   on December 2, the immediate reaction was uproar over his apparently impetuous breach of decades of U. S. protocol toward China and Taiwan. As my colleague David Graham explained, since 1979, the United States has participated in the “artful diplomatic fiction” of officially recognizing the mainland People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate Chinese government while maintaining loose, unofficial recognition of —  and significant economic and military ties to —  Taiwan. That Trump would speak to the president of Taiwan, especially before doing the same with Xi Jinping, the president of the PRC, flies in the face of a diplomatic tradition that has undergirded almost 40 years of U. S.  relations. Amid the days of dissembling that followed the phone call, an additional worrisome detail came out: At the time, the Trump Organization was apparently exploring expansion into Taiwan. Soon afterwards, the Trump Organization denied that it planned to do so however, even before the controversy arose, the mayor of Taoyuan, Taiwan, the municipality in which the Trump Organization allegedly wants to build, described in a televised interview a meeting with a representative of the Trump Organization in September to discuss prospective   projects, and at least one Trump employee was found to have posted on Facebook that she was in Taiwan at the time on a business trip. Based on the January 11 announcement that the Trump Organization will be suspending its development plans and will not pursue foreign deals in office, it would appear that any movement on development in Taiwan is no longer on the table. The phone call, and the many statements that have followed, are of particular interest because of the extent to which they dovetail with some of the biggest concerns about Trump’s approach toward governance. In the ensuing 48 hours, Republican officials offered several, sometimes entirely contradictory, explanations of what initially appeared to be an impulsive move by Trump depending on who was speaking, the phone call was actually initiated by   (which, if technically true, ignores that it was Trump’s staff who arranged the conversation) was just “a courtesy,” or manifested a policy shift weeks in the making —  although, regardless, it was made without first consulting the White House or State Department. The defense of the move, and the questions it creates regarding conflicts of interest, have largely hinged on the belief that, since voters apparently don’t mind, the reaction was overblown. On this issue, though, whether or not voters care is immaterial to the central question. The   of the United States breached decades of international protocol created to preserve a precarious balance of power. That decision raised not only the possibility that Trump was blundering into a potential international incident but also that he may have done so in part out of consideration for his business prospects. Back to table of contents, That Deutsche Bank Debt, Though he often brags about leveraging   law to become “The King of Debt,” Trump’s numerous bankruptcy filings have left most large Wall Street banks reticent to lend to him, according to The Wall Street Journal. Among the few exceptions is Deutsche Bank, which “has led or participated in loans of at least $2. 5 billion” to the   since 1996, with at least another $1 billion in loan commitments to   companies more than $300 million of those loans have come since 2012. The  ’s indebtedness does not itself pose a conflict of interest, but Deutsche Bank’s ongoing legal troubles very well might. The Justice Department is currently negotiating with Deutsche Bank regarding a preliminary settlement of $14 billion to resolve probes into allegedly misleading predatory lending practices in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis while it is believed that Deutsche Bank will push back against the sum, there has been no public news regarding negotiations since the initial figure was reported in September. Trump will soon be naming many of the officials with jurisdiction over this and other deals, prompting several House Democrats to send a letter to federal financial agencies calling for close scrutiny of how Trump may seek to influence the settlement through his appointments —  although doing so would be just as in keeping with his general stance toward financial regulation as with active protection of his pocketbook. Other Democrats have called for the proactive appointment of independent prosecutors to avoid any appearance of conflict if the case is not resolved before Trump takes office. Fears that Trump may unduly consider his indebtedness to Deutsche Bank in deciding his administration’s policy toward the financial sector go beyond general anxiety about deregulation. Deutsche Bank is undergoing a period of struggle that may have it on the verge of failure already. Its stock valuation has dropped by more than half since July 2015 in January, it posted its first   loss since 2008 and one of its many tranches of bonds —  one specifically designed to be a     safety valve in times of trouble —  has recently begun to crash. In June, the International Monetary Fund called Deutsche Bank “the most important net contributor to systemic risks” among globally important financial institutions. If the bank were to fail, it could have major consequences for not only Trump’s businesses, which would lose their sole remaining lender, but for the global economy as well. Arguably, the $14 billion fine the Justice Department is seeking to impose has exacerbated rather than alleviated these struggles. Based the company’s market capitalization —  the number of shares multiplied by their price —   of roughly $16 billion, the sum would leave Deutsche Bank critically low in liquid assets with which to absorb future troubles. although the institution’s own   of $68 billion argues otherwise. But given the complexity and potential volatility of the situation, it is important for any decision to be free from outside influence, something Trump’s outstanding debt threatens to jeopardize. Back to table of contents, That Secret Service Detail, During the election, the Trump campaign put no small portion of its funds toward paying for use of the candidate’s own properties perhaps the most notable of these expenditures was the nearly $170, 000 the campaign spent in July on rent for its headquarters in Trump Tower. These expenses raised the possibility that, as Trump predicted in 2000, he “could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it. ” Now that he will be president, he may be able to profit off of the Secret Service by virtue of the fact that he and his family will live in Trump Tower and fly in his private jets —  which requires the agents tasked with guarding them to pay him rent and airfare. The first way Trump could monetize his own protective detail is by having family members travel in his two planes and three helicopters. This is not so much speculative as foregone: Over the course of the campaign, the Secret Service, which traditionally pays for its own travel during elections, spent $2. 74 million to fly on a plane owned by one of Trump’s own companies. Once Trump takes office, he will fly exclusively on Air Force One, while Mike Pence will be riding Air Force Two. However, their families may still be flying on Trump’s private planes —  along with their protective details, which would effectively direct even more money to Trump. (Previous first families have flown with a detail, whose legal purview covers “the immediate family members,” but none have done so on planes they themselves own.) A bigger question regards Trump Tower in New York, where the   appears likely to spend a significant amount of time. For the past few decades, it has been common practice for the Secret Service to provide protection for the president and vice president’s   House residences, which sometimes entails paying rent to the officeholder. (Joe Biden, for example, received $2, 200 per month when the agency rented a cottage he owned near his home in Delaware.) But Trump Tower is a unique case, as it’s not in Delaware but the middle of Manhattan. Already, pedestrians and tourists are chafing at the increased security around the building, Trump’s frequent use of which has required closing a block of 56th Street and multiple lanes of Fifth Avenue with multiple outlets reporting that Trump’s wife Melania and    son Barron are expected to stay at Trump Tower for at least part of his term, it appears that the consternation will continue, with an enormous price tag for taxpayers: According to the New York Post, it could cost as much as $3 million a year to rent out two of the building’s vacant floors, meaning that Trump will be making money off of his own security detail. Meanwhile, Reuters has reported that the city of New York is calling for federal funds to reimburse the costs of keeping up a security detail around Trump Tower. This system creates an unusual set of conflicting interests for Trump regarding his own travel and residences. Though presidents as disparate as Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama have evoked partisan ire over time spent away from the White House, whether on the golf course or on vacation in Hawaii, only Donald Trump will actually have gained from his and his family’s travels. And if, while in office, Trump visits properties he owns other than Trump Tower —  his buildings in other U. S. cities like Chicago and Miami, for example, or his golf course and resort in Scotland, or one of the many international hotels bearing his name —  he stands to gain from the stays for which his security detail (and, by extension, taxpayers) may be paying. Moreover, the more his family members fly on his planes, whether they are running his business on his behalf or running interference with foreign leaders, the more the Secret Service will end up paying for seats alongside them. In fact, there are already signs that the Trump Organization has no qualms about making money off of the New York tower’s new security arrangements in more ways than one. According to Politico, just five days after the election, a prominent New York   firm invoked Trump Tower’s new   detail as a selling point for a $2. 1 million condominium, which it described as “The Best Value in the Most Secure Building in Manhattan. ” Though the flier was issued by an outside agency, the  ’s corporation still stands to benefit from increased traffic through processing and other service fees, making the advertisement a clear example of how Trump stands to benefit off of his new position. Back to table of contents, That Property in Georgia (the Country) Trump’s election has had the effect of speeding up development on a number of his branded properties, even when the   appears not to be pulling any strings himself. As occurred with Trump Tower Buenos Aires, the completion of an embattled   building in the former Soviet republic of Georgia is no longer on hold now that Trump has won. The project, which has been in the works in the seaside resort city of Batumi since 2010, was initially scheduled to break ground in 2013, but has been in stasis for several reasons, possibly including the 2013 electoral defeat of President Mikheil Saakashvili, a friend of Trump’s and a supporter of the deal. According to a report in The Washington Post, the   of the Trump property in Batumi has not been linked to a specific conversation with Georgian leaders, and a U. S.  partner on the project has suggested that it has moved forward without any nudging from the government. However, numerous public statements in the days since suggest that Trump’s election was a major factor, including an interview with a   entrepreneur who said, “Cutting the ribbon on a new Trump Tower in Georgia will be a symbol of victory for all of the free world. ” That the property seems to be moving forward solely because Trump was elected suggests his various business interests around the world may play a role not only in his foreign policy but in how other countries seek to deal with the U. S. as well. America’s relationship with Georgia is largely shaped by concerns about Russian influence and potential aggression in the region, most recently manifested in Russia’s 2008 seizure of two regions of Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. With controversy already swirling over Trump’s admiration for Putin and Russia’s alleged role in the U. S. election, some in the   community have expressed trepidation that Trump’s potential deferential attitude toward Russia would prove deleterious for the continued independence of former satellite nations like Georgia. So, if Georgia has an ulterior motive behind the approval of Trump’s property in Batumi, it would be to keep Russia at bay and maintain the status quo in the region. According to Trump and his lawyer, as of January 11, the Trump Organization has suspended ongoing development projects and will no longer pursue deals in foreign countries. As the project in Batumi falls under both categories, the statement suggests that progress on the  ’s property in the city is no longer moving forward. Still, it’s alarming that a country like Georgia may be giving Trump’s businesses favorable treatment (whether he asked for it or not) in an attempt to influence his foreign policy. Back to table of contents, That Phone Call With Erdogan, One of the worries regarding Trump’s many conflicts of interest is that they may influence policy towards countries whose relationships with the U. S. are currently strained. Such is the case with Turkey, whose president, Recep Erdogan, has been cracking down significantly on civil liberties and democratic institutions within the country after a failed coup last summer. Though Turkey has in the past been a vital U. S. ally as a bulwark against Islamic terror, Erdogan’s authoritarian turn and combative stance toward Europe have led to some reevaluation of that relationship. Thus, it was troubling news that when Erdogan phoned Trump earlier this month —  it was one of the first calls Trump received after his victory —  Trump used the opportunity to plug his business partners in Istanbul. According to the Huffington Post, while on the line with Erdogan, Trump relayed praise for the leader from Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, whose    Aydin Dogan, owns the holding company that operates the Trump Towers in Istanbul. Dogan has previously drawn Erdogan’s ire by criticizing the leader in recent years, however, Dogan’s companies, most notably CNN Turk, have shown support for Erdogan’s regime, including broadcasting his first message after the uprising in July. Trump’s conversation with Erdogan is also worth noting because of a number of Trump’s previous statements regarding the Turkish president. Though Erdogan briefly called for Trump’s name to be removed from the Istanbul property due to his proposed ban on Muslim immigration, Erdogan dropped the demand when, after the overthrow attempt, Trump praised Erdogan for “turning it around” and essentially dismissed concerns over Erdogan’s crackdown on civil liberties by bringing up domestic problems. Michael Flynn, who was recently named Trump’s national security adviser, wrote an     in The Hill arguing against offering asylum to a Muslim cleric whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating the uprising, which some have interpreted as a diplomatic overture. Erdogan has also bristled at   protests in the U. S. and the description of both himself and Trump as part of a “ring of autocrats. ” That the two are now talking about their countries’ relationship as in the same conversation as Trump’s business interests further complicates Trump’s strangely effusive comments about Erdogan. It’s worth noting that Trump himself considers his hotel in Istanbul a potential conflict of interest. In a December 2015 interview with Stephen Bannon, at the time the chairman of Breitbart News, Trump said as much, telling Bannon, “I have a little conflict of interest ‘cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul. It’s a tremendously successful job.” That he chose to discuss the towers with Erdogan, albeit obliquely, through his references to his business partners when he has already acknowledged the impropriety of doing so simply reinforces the perception that he may prove unable to separate his business from his official duties once he assumes office.   Back to table of contents, That Hotel in Washington, D. C. The White House is not the only new Trump property in Washington, D. C. there’s also the new Trump International Hotel, which opened in October and is located just a few blocks away in what was formerly known as the Old Post Office Pavilion. Previously, the hotel played a role in the campaign as the site of the event at which Trump recanted (sort of) his belief that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Now, the hotel is at the center of speculation as a symbol of how inextricable Trump’s presidential role may be from his personal interests. First and foremost, Trump does not own the location outright instead, he leases the building from the federal government’s General Services Administration, an agency whose next administrator Trump will soon be appointing. The GSA has explicit regulations prohibiting contracts with government employees to prevent conflicts “that might arise between the employees’ interests and their Government duties, and to avoid the appearance of favoritism or preferential treatment. ” The Trump Organization’s   lease on the property likewise states, “no . .. elected official of the Government of the United States . .. shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom. ” According to House Democrats, the GSA has ruled that Trump “will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office” and must divest from the property before he does so. As if its location didn’t pose enough of an ethical question, the hotel has already hosted at least one promotional event specifically aimed at enticing foreign diplomats to stay at the establishment while in town on official state business. On the one hand, direct influence will likely be difficult to prove: The establishment is, after all, a   hotel that would have been likely to attract   clientele even if Trump had lost the election, a fact to which Trump and those who surround him may well point in order to maintain a patina of respectability around their dealings. Still, the meeting’s proximity to the election reinforces that it will be worth watching the comings and goings at the hotel closely for signs that Trump, who so often accused his opponent (often without evidence) of    may be using his position as president to promote his businesses. Trump himself acknowledged that his presidency is likely to increase traffic to his Washington, D. C. property. Speaking to The New York Times, the   noted that the property is “probably a more valuable asset than it was before” and that his brand is “hotter” since the election. However, he went on to insist that there was nothing even potentially problematic about his unprecedented situation and that he sees no reason why he couldn’t run both the presidency and his business without conflict. Multiple events since the election have made Trump’s lease on the hotel a central focus of discussions of his conflicts of interest, including among Democrats in the House. On November 29, Bahrain —  a country whose donations to the Clinton Foundation Trump and his campaign decried during the campaign —  announced that it would be celebrating the anniversary of its king’s ascension to the throne at the hotel. Other events announced since the election include a Hannukah celebration   by the Embassy of Azerbaijan and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and a reception for the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation featuring Vice   Mike Pence as its keynote speaker. Numerous ethics experts, many of whom are calling for Trump to generally divest his business holdings, have singled out the building’s lease, which will likely be breached the moment Trump takes office even if he does transfer his company to his children. And on November 30, mere hours after Trump stated on Twitter that “legal documents are being crafted which take [him] completely out of business operations,” Buzzfeed reported that Trump and the federal government were closing in on a tax subsidy for the property that could be worth as much as $32 million. As a result of the increasing scrutiny, the hotel and his handling of the commotion about it have become emblematic of the broader issues surrounding Trump’s conflicts of interest. Back to table of contents, That Argentinian Office Building, According to a report by the prominent Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata, the  ’s first phone call with his Argentine counterpart Mauricio Macri included a discussion of the permit issues currently holding up construction of a new   office building in Buenos Aires. Both Macri and Trump quickly denied the report according to a statement from the Embassy of Argentina, “The subject both leaders talked about was the institutional relationship, and they briefly mentioned the personal relationship they have had for years. ” As summarized in a tweetstorm here, Trump’s relationship with Argentina’s government and business elites —  and the story so far on his property there —  is already long and convoluted. The phone call with Macri was apparently set up through Felipe Yaryura, one of Trump’s longtime associates whose company, YY Development Group, is in charge of Trump Tower Buenos Aires. The day after the phone call, the PanAm Post reported that YY Development Group had been approved to break ground in June 2017 evidence has since emerged that the permitting process is not, in fact, finished, although Trump’s business associates are moving ahead as though it is. Based on the information at the  ’s January 11 press conference, it appears that the properties in Argentina, as both ongoing development projects and deals in a foreign country, is no longer moving forward. Nevertheless, the questionable circumstances under which it did so in the immediate aftermath of the election demonstrates just how many avenues there are for Trump’s conflicts of interest to interfere with governance around the world.   Back to table of contents, Those Companies in Saudi Arabia, Even as Trump was running for president, his company was continuing to operate and open new properties. While the most memorable openings may have been that of his hotel in Washington, D. C. and his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, the Trump Organization was continuing to work on projects in other countries, including, according to a report the Washington Post, registering eight new companies in Saudi Arabia during the   campaign. The organization’s endeavors in Saudi Arabia are notable not only because they may further complicate the shaky relationship between the U. S. and an   gulf state notorious for   abuses but also because of how they relate to Trump’s campaign rhetoric. One of his criticisms of Hillary Clinton was that her charitable foundation had accepted donations from governments with questionable records on human rights, most notably Qatar and Saudi Arabia, always with the implication (or direct accusation) that they were doing so to curry favor with Clinton when she was secretary of state. That Trump was continuing to level this criticism while his namesake organization was actively pursuing new projects in Saudi Arabia not only bodes ill for his ability to separate his personal and presidential interests but also further calls into question the honesty and transparency of his campaign. Back to table of contents, That British Wind Farm, As he indicated when he stopped there during the campaign,   Trump takes enormous pride in his recently opened golf course in Turnberry, Scotland. The day after the British public voted for Brexit —  over intense Scottish opposition —  Trump spoke at the property’s opening, proudly touting how the decision’s deflationary effect on the pound would benefit his business. However, Trump also has a second golf course in Aberdeen, where it appears Trump has attempted to intercede in the interest of his own pocketbook.* According to The New York Times, Trump had a   meeting with Nigel Farage in which he “encouraged Mr. Farage and his entourage to oppose the kind of offshore wind farms that Mr. Trump believes will mar the pristine view from one of his two Scottish golf courses. ” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the   denied that the two had discussed the subject, only for Trump to later confirm that the topic had, in fact, come up in their conversation. * This entry originally misstated that Trump intervened at Turnberry, his other golf course in Scotland. We regret the error.   Back to table of contents, Those Indian Business Partners, It didn’t take long after the election for   Trump to be seen in public with international business partners. According to a November 19 article in The New York Times, Trump took a break from his transition schedule to meet with three Indian   executives who are currently building a   apartment complex in Mumbai. According to both Trump and the Indian businessmen, the meeting was essentially congratulatory in nature a picture posted by one of the executives on Twitter shows the four men smiling broadly and giving a   to the camera. However, that the meeting happened in the first place suggests that Trump does not currently have any qualms about forestalling official state business for personal business. On top of that, the meeting raises questions in the   realm as well. The   himself was not the only member of his family there two Facebook photos show that Ivanka and Eric Trump both attended the meeting as well. Their presence serves as a reminder that their father seems so far uninterested in maintaining even the nominal separation between himself and his assets that he repeatedly said he would create during the campaign. Back to table of contents, That Envoy From the Philippines, One leader with whom Trump already has an advantage over President Obama is Rodrigo Duterte, the similarly brash president of the Philippines. Duterte, who has threatened to “break up with America,” told Obama to “go to hell,” and called the president a “son of a whore,” expressed admiration for Trump, noting that, among other similarities, they both enjoy swearing. Duterte’s affinity for Trump apparently goes beyond vulgar word choice. Late in October, Duterte appointed a longtime business associate of Trump’s as a special envoy to the United States, an announcement that became public shortly after the election. This appointment in particular raises questions because it is just as open to exploitation by Duterte as it is to Trump, as the Filipino president could intend to use his new envoy’s relationship with Trump to strengthen the Philippines’ hand. Whichever side the appointment does eventually benefit, however, the situation is nevertheless fraught with conflicts between the three men’s personal and political interests.

53381,73583,When Are You Too Stoned to Drive?,Atlantic,Beth Schwartzapfel,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"Late one February night in 2013, Massachusetts state trooper Eric French pulled over a blue SUV with its rear lights out. When he approached the car, he saw smoke and smelled pot. The driver, Thomas Gerhardt, could count backwards from 75 to 62 and recite the alphabet from D to Q. But he couldn’t stand on one leg or walk nine steps and turn, standard measures on a field sobriety test. The trooper determined that Gerhardt was impaired, and he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of marijuana. Was Gerhardt even high? And if he was, was he too high to drive safely? This month his lawyer argued before the state’s high court that French proved neither that night. Massachusetts is one of eight states, plus the District of Columbia, where recreational marijuana use is now legal. Twenty more states have legalized use of medical marijuana. But science and the law have not kept pace with this rapid political change. We take for granted that not being able to walk a straight line or stand on one leg means that you’re drunk, and that being drunk means it’s unacceptably dangerous to drive. But there is no clear scientific consensus when it comes to smoking pot and driving. And few of the tools police officers have long relied on to determine whether a driver is too drunk to drive, like a breathalyzer, exist for marijuana. Cases like Gerhardt’s are on the front lines of a new effort in courtrooms, labs, and government agencies around the country to pin down how high is too high to drive —  and how to reliably know when someone is as high as that. Most (but not all) studies find that using pot impairs one’s ability to drive. However, overall, the impairment appears to be modest —  akin to driving with a blood alcohol level of between . 01 and . 05, which is legal in all states. (The much greater risk is in combining pot with alcohol.) The increased crash risk with pot alone “is so small you can compare it to driving in darkness compared to driving in daylight,” says University of Oslo political scientist Rune Elvik, who conducted several major   evaluating the risk of drugged driving. “Nobody would consider banning people from driving in the dark. If you tried to impose some kind of consistency standard, then there is no strong case, really, for banning it. ” When it comes to alcohol, science and the courts have long established a direct line between number of drinks, blood alcohol level, and crash risk. As one goes up, so do the others. Not so for pot. Scientists can’t say with confidence how much pot, in what concentration, used in what period of time, will reliably make someone “high. ” (This is especially difficult to gauge because most of the existing studies used pot provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which tends to be a lot less potent than what smokers can buy on the street or in pot shops.) Blood levels of THC —  tetrahydrocannabinol, the chemical component of pot that makes you high —  spike quickly after smoking and then decline rapidly in the hours afterwards, during the window when a smoker would feel most high. What’s more, regular smokers could have THC in their blood for days or weeks after smoking, when they are clearly no longer high. Still, laws in 18 states tie drugged driving charges to whether drivers have THC (or related compounds) in their blood. Some states prohibit driving with any amount, and some specify a threshold modeled after the . 08 limit states use for blood alcohol. But the lag time between being pulled over and being transported to a hospital for a blood draw —  on average, more than two hours —  can lead to false negatives, while the tolerance developed by regular users (and the tendency for THC to stick around in their bloodstreams) can lead to false positives. This is why, researchers say, blood THC laws make little sense. “If you’re stopping someone who just tried it or uses it occasionally, a little bit of THC goes a long way —  they’re very impaired,” says Washington State University political scientist Nicholas Lovrich. “But people are demonstrably able to drive at high levels of THC if they’re a frequent user. ” The more sensible strategy appears to be prohibiting driving while high, and 31 states take this approach. But proving that a driver is high turns out to be tricky terrain, too. One of the issues that Thomas Gerhardt raises in his lawsuit is whether police officers with standard training are qualified to make a judgment that a driver is high. Courts in a few states, including New Jersey, Vermont, and Montana, have ruled that they are not. “Unlike alcohol intoxication,” the New Jersey high court ruled in 2006, “no   …     general awareness exists as yet with regard to the signs and symptoms of the condition described as being ‘high’ on marijuana. ” Research shows that failing a standard field sobriety test (a series of tasks like walking a straight line) correlates closely with having a blood alcohol level above the legal limit —  plus officers have a breathalyzer to confirm their findings. But “the gap between assessment, cannabis use, and driving is really not completely closed,” says Professor Thomas Marcotte of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of   Diego. Frequent pot users —  even when they’re not stoned —  may not be able to stand on one leg, for example, whether they’re safe to drive or not. Marcotte and his colleagues are working on validating a new field sobriety test calibrated for pot use. Their   measures test skills like tracking an object on the screen and accurately estimating time. (Police may not yet have a validated tool, but for those who want to gauge their own ability to drive after smoking, apps have begun to appear that measure things like reaction time and   coordination.) Some police departments use drug recognition experts, specially trained officers dispatched to evaluate suspected drugged drivers. Commonly referred to as DREs, these officers use an     process, including taking the suspect’s blood pressure and pulse, conducting several eye exams and balance tests, to generate an opinion about whether the driver is intoxicated, and, if so, by what. Preliminary research seems to indicate their opinions are of mixed quality, and not all judges allow DREs to testify to their findings. “They’re not EMTs. They’re not medically trained,” says Lovrich, the Washington State University professor, who, in a recent study of five years of DRE data in Washington and New Mexico, found a   rate for pot intoxication ranging from 38 percent to 68 percent. “Everyone in the DRE business knows it’s really hard to do this. ” The gold standard would be a   device that can objectively measure whether someone has recently smoked, and how much. Lovrich is working on developing such a tool, using the same type of technology that security screeners use at airports to check for explosives. He says it will be at least two years before the technology is perfected, miniaturized, and engineered to be durable enough to toss in the back seat of a squad car. In the meantime, people like Thomas Gerhardt will fight it out in state courts. A ruling on his case is expected this spring.

53382,73584,A Defamation Suit Against the President-Elect,Atlantic,Nora Kelly,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"Former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, one of multiple women who’ve accused   Donald Trump of sexual assault or misconduct, is now suing him for defamation. Zervos first went public in   alleging that Trump   kissed and groped her at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007, where she met with him to discuss a job opportunity. Zervos announced the defamation suit alongside her lawyer, Gloria Allred —  who’s representing several Trump accusers —  at a press conference Tuesday in Los Angeles, as thousands of miles away organizers of Trump’s inauguration continue preparing the U. S. Capitol grounds. When Are You Too Stoned to Drive? Reading from the lawsuit, which she said was filed in New York Tuesday morning, Allred explained that Zervos initially thought Trump’s alleged behavior was an aberration, a test, or something he regretted. But soon, “Summer Zervos saw Trump’s behavior for what it was: that of a sexual predator,” Allred said in her opening statement. Multiple women levied   or   allegations against Trump last fall after the release of a 2005 video from the   show Access Hollywood. In the video, Trump is heard bragging on a hot mic about kissing and groping women without their consent —  conduct he’s repeatedly denied ever engaging in. The Washington Post has a detailed rundown of all the women who’ve levied accusations against Trump, from Jessica Leeds, who told The New York Times that Trump groped her on an airplane in the early 1980s, to Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporter who claims Trump “forc[ed] his tongue down my throat” while she was on assignment in 2005. According to Allred, it was after hearing Trump’s words on the 2005 tape that Zervos realized she was “just one of many women who’d been victimized” by Trump’s alleged “predatory conduct. ” Afterward, she retained Allred’s counsel and first discussed her story publicly at an October news conference. Trump has responded to all of the women’s allegations the same way, by denying their claims and criticizing them personally —  attacking their credibility, their character, and their looks. “These people are horrible people, they’re horrible, horrible liars. And interestingly, it happens to appear 26 days before our very important election, isn’t that amazing?” Trump said at a   rally, where he framed the accusations as part of a conspiracy to undermine his campaign. “Look at her, look at her words,” he instructed the crowd, referencing Stoynoff’s appearance. “You tell me, what you think. I don’t think so. ” Others in the Trump campaign also tried to discredit his accusers, and Trump himself said he’d take legal action against them. “All of these liars will be sued after the election is over,” Trump said in late October. In response to that threat —  which never came to fruition —  Allred told reporters at a   press conference in November that she might sue him. At Tuesday’s news conference, Allred said Trump had used “his national and international bully pulpit” to make false statements and “verbally attack” Zerbos and the other women. His statements against Zervos —  claiming she made up her story, that he wasn’t inappropriate with her, that she and other women lied —  were defamatory, Allred said. “I wanted to give Mr. Trump the opportunity to retract his false statements about me and the other women who came forward,” Zervos told reporters on Tuesday. Because he’s done so such thing, “he’s therefore left me with no alternative than to sue him in order to vindicate my reputation. ” Zervos said she would still dismiss the suit if Trump were to withdraw his earlier statements and say that she’s been telling the truth.   That doesn’t seem likely to happen. Asked for comment on the lawsuit, Hope Hicks, a Trump   spokeswoman, said: “More of the same from Gloria Allred. There is no truth to this absurd story. ” Zervos’s lawsuit is the first to come out of the   or   allegations against Trump. But it’s not the only suit the   is involved in. As of late December, Trump was in the midst of several cases stemming from his   business, as well as “a number of active lawsuits” that stem from activity at his campaign rallies, as CNN has reported. Zervos might not be the only woman to take the lawsuit route, either. Allred is representing other women who’ve levied accusations about Trump, and he’s criticized them publicly as a group. More, similar cases could arise. Trump hasn’t yet made a public statement about the Zervos lawsuit, but he can probably be expected to issue one. Since winning the presidential election,   Trump has comported himself in much the same way as Candidate Trump. He still uses Twitter regularly to communicate with his supporters and critique his critics, most recently targeting   icon Representative John Lewis of Georgia for refusing to attend his inauguration. Given how harshly Trump condemned his accusers in the weeks leading up to his election, it’s possible the    U. S. president will launch similar attacks as the lawsuit proceeds. Only this time, those attacks would come from the White House."
53383,73585,The Trump Administration’s Conflicts of Interest: Scott Pruitt Edition,Atlantic,Jeremy Venook,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0,,"As with so many of Trump’s appointees so far, Scott Pruitt, the  ’s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, has a long history of opposition to the very department he is expected to lead. As the attorney general for the state of Oklahoma, Pruitt spent his tenure fighting EPA regulations, including joining with several other Republican attorneys general in a number of lawsuits against the agency over the Obama administration’s plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to Democrats in the Senate, this history of antagonism toward the EPA involves conflicts of interest that could undermine his ability to execute his role with the organization. In a letter to the Office of Government Ethics, several Senators expressed concerns that Pruitt’s history of accepting large donations from   companies could impact his decisions. In particular, they pointed to his involvement in numerous Political Action Committees, most notably the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a nonprofit offshoot of the Republican Attorneys General Association that has received at least $175, 000 in donations from the Koch brothers’ lobbying group Freedom Partners. Pruitt, his opponents say, has “blurred the distinction between official and political actions, often at the behest of corporations he will regulate if confirmed to lead [the] EPA,” and he and his staff “have worked closely with fossil fuel lobbyists to craft his office’s official positions. ” Pruitt has announced that he will be stepping down from his position as chairman of the RLDF, and two PACs that support him plan to shut down however, Protecting America Now, a   organization supporting Pruitt, is expected to remain active, creating an avenue by which companies could seek to inappropriately influence his behavior in office. Pruitt’s behavior as Oklahoma’s attorney general compounds concerns about Pruitt’s coziness with corporate donors. In 2010, Pruitt inherited from his predecessor a lawsuit against Tyson Foods and several other major poultry companies over the allegation that chicken manure was polluting Oklahoma’s water the lawsuit could have resulted in tens of millions of dollars in damages. Pruitt, who received tens of thousands in campaign contributions from the poultry industry, chose to drop the lawsuit. Moreover, 13 of the 14 suits Pruitt helped bring against the EPA over federal regulations involved at least one company that had donated to Pruitt or a PAC from which he had benefited. According to ABC, Pruitt twice joined lawsuits against the EPA on behalf of Murray Energy, an   coal company that then donated to the Republican Attorneys General Association, an organization Pruitt chaired. In another instance, Pruitt sent a letter to the EPA alleging that federal regulators had overestimated   wells’ contribution to air pollution in Oklahoma according to The New York Times, however, “the   letter was written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of Oklahoma’s biggest    companies, and was delivered to him by Devon’s chief of lobbying. ” Pruitt also has a   conflict of interest: He is currently suing the EPA over the Clean Power Plan, one of President Obama’s signature energy policies, and the suit appears likely to continue well into his term as head of the agency. Though Pruitt’s ethics pact with the Office of Government Ethics will require him to receive outside authorization before engaging “personally and substantially in particular matters” involving Oklahoma for his first year in office, when pressed on the matter in his confirmation hearing, he refused to commit to recuse himself from the case —  not to mention that, even if he does, his leadership of the organization is likely to weigh heavily on the   process of those tasked with carrying out the agency’s defense in court. The Background, With confirmation hearings beginning, attention is shifting slightly away from Trump and toward those who may make up his administration. Like the   under whom they may soon be serving, many of Trump’s nominees have been pulled from the upper echelons of the business community or are otherwise political outsiders. Also like Trump, many of them have come under significant scrutiny for how their pasts may lead to conflicts of interest with the roles they are nominated to serve. These are especially noteworthy because, unlike during the transitions to previous administrations, it appears that this year’s confirmation hearings will begin before the Office of Government Ethics has had adequate time to perform background checks. This highly unusual turn of events goes against the explicit objection of the Director of the OGE, who wrote in a letter to the Senate’s Democratic leadership that he is “not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate has held a confirmation hearing before the nominee has completed the ethics review” and warned, “For as long as I am Director, OGE’s staff and agency ethics officials will not succumb to pressure to cut corners and ignore conflicts of interest. ” (Also of note is a letter from current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who in 2008 sent   Majority Leader Harry Reid a letter detailing his expectations for thorough ethical clearance but is now questioning the motives of those calling for the same for Trump’s nominees.) Moreover, in contrast with the rules for the president, there are both explicit rules regarding conflicts of interest for appointed officials and a long history of appointed officials abusing their offices for personal financial gain. With regard to the former, the law “prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests” or those of his family members, a general partner, or any organization with whom he or she “serves as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, or employee” or may one day be employed. Violations could result in jail time of up to five years, a fine of up to $50, 000, or both investigations into alleged misconduct fall under the purview of the Justice Department. For the latter, perhaps the most infamous example of   officeholders acting in their personal financial interests is the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s, in which Warren G. Harding’s Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall was convicted of accepting bribes in administering the leases for oil reserves in Wyoming and California. The administration of Ulysses S. Grant, meanwhile, was plagued by scandals in seven federal departments, ranging from gold speculation in the State Department to bribery for postal contracts, to the Whiskey Ring scandal, which led to the resignation of Grant’s Supervisor of Internal Revenue and his personal secretary. In recent decades, more than 100 of Ronald Reagan’s appointees, including Attorney General Edwin Meese and Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver, were investigated for financial impropriety, leading to numerous firings and resignations. During the Obama administration, opponents accused Steven Spinner, who served in multiple   roles in the Department of Energy, of inappropriately pushing for a $535 million loan guarantee for the solar company Solyndra while his wife worked at a law firm representing the company. Even more recently, allegations of conflicts of interest were arguably central to the 2016 presidential campaign, in which Trump repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton of inappropriately commingling her office as Secretary of State with her family’s foundation. Adding to all of these concerns is the fact that Trump’s family members appear likely to have a larger role in his administration than a president’s family has had in any administration since John F. Kennedy’s appointment of his brother as Attorney General led to the creation of     laws. Ivanka Trump, for example, is poised to take on many of the duties typically expected of a First Lady, and has sat in on at least one of her father’s meeting with a    her adult siblings, Donald Jr. and Eric, are members of their father’s transition team and often seen as among his closest confidants, although it remains unclear what, if any, official roles they will take on in his administration. And Trump’s    Jared Kushner, whom many expect will be one of the  ’s top advisers once he takes office, has   and publishing interests of his own that could intersect with his official duties. As my colleague Olga Khazan noted, the question with conflicts of interest is not if, but when and how much they will affect behavior. Research into doctors who receive gifts from drug companies —  often as apparently meaningless as a pen or clipboard —  shows that “even small kickbacks can change   individuals’ behavior” by subtly changing how a doctor perceives the company behind the gift. As such, The Atlantic will be expanding our coverage of Trump’s conflicts of interests to include those expected to serve in his administration. Below is the current list of Trump’s prospective administration members, official and otherwise, whose actions or financial entanglements have prompted concerns over conflicts of interest. Because the law requires most aspirants for   positions to resolve such questions before entering office, some have already taken the steps necessary to mitigate conflicts of interest these steps will be noted as applicable. The most recent updates appear at the top: Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, In terms of policy, Representative Tom Price,   Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is perhaps best known for his strident stance against the Affordable Care Act. The Republican congressman (and former orthopedic surgeon) from Georgia has been one of Obamacare’s most vocal opponents over the past several years and is the author of the Empowering Patients First Act, one of the more comprehensive replacement plans the GOP has so far put forth. Price, as one of Trump’s nominees who comes from government rather than the private sector, does not have business entanglements nearly on par with many of the  ’s other picks. Still, there have been concerns about his conflicts of interest during his tenure as a congressman, and while Price has complied with ethics rules in advance of his congressional hearing, his past behavior would seem to make him an odd fit for a position in the proposed Cabinet of a president who ran on an explicitly   platform. The concerns about Price’s conflicts of interest as a congressman involve stocks he purchased while in office. According to The Wall Street Journal, Price has bought and sold more than $300, 000 worth of stocks in healthcare, pharmaceutical, and biomedical companies since 2012. Meanwhile, he was the sponsor of nine   bills in the house, as well as a   on 35 more. Time, meanwhile, determined that Price invested as much as $90, 000 across six pharmaceutical companies shortly before participating in an ultimately successful campaign to block a regulatory change that would have damaged those companies’ bottom lines. According to The Daily Beast, at least one of Price’s stock deals was possible precisely because of his position. Rather than issue stock on the open market to raise capital, a small Australian biotech firm called Innate Immunotherapeutics chose to offer stock to “sophisticated U. S. investors” at a deeply discounted rate, at one point selling shares valued at 90 cents to Price and others for 18 cents apiece. According to Price’s financial forms, he bought between $50, 000 and $100, 000 of the stock in 2016 and, as of their report, has seen a 400 percent paper gain. According to both The Daily Beast and The Wall Street Journal, Price has after his nomination complied with necessary disclosure rules and will be divesting from about 40 companies, Innate included, that would otherwise create conflicts of interest during his tenure in the Cabinet. However, as with many biotech startups, Innate Immunotherapeutics’ viability rests in part on whether it is able to secure approval from the Food and Drug Administration, which is a part of HHS, the very department Price will likely soon be leading. The company is currently seeking to move forward with testing of a new treatment for multiple sclerosis. It certainly can’t hurt that the man in charge of the agency that will be deciding its fate will have likely made a tidy sum off of the special deal he received on the company’s stock. More specific accusations have arisen about Price’s stock in the   manufacturer Zimmer Biomet. According to CNN, Price bought between $1, 001 and $15, 000 worth of shares in the company in March 2016. Less than a week later, Price introduced an act that, had it been passed, would have been a major boon to Zimmer Biomet. The bill, which never made it to a full vote, concerned a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (also part of HHS) regulation regarding payments for knee and hip implant procedures which, if implemented, would have been significantly damaging to Zimmer Biomet’s position as one of the leading manufacturers of the implants. Price’s bill, however, would have delayed the new CMS rule, thereby helping the company. Shortly afterward, Zimmer Biomet’s political action committee donated to Price’s reelection campaign. Though, as is often the case, evidence of a direct causal relationship between Price’s purchase, the bill, and the later donation is elusive, the confluence has been enough for some opponents, most notably Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, to posit that Price’s behavior may have broken the law.  Back to table of contents, Trump’s Family Members, Though Trump has not —  in fact, cannot —  appointed any members of his direct family to a post in his administration, it nevertheless appears that they will likely have significant input in his administration. According to numerous sources, Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka, is likely to take on a policy portfolio roughly on par with that of a typical first lady just what it will comprise is not yet known, although based on meetings she has taken since the election with Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore, climate change has arisen as a possibility. Meanwhile, according to NBC, her husband, Jared Kushner, will be serving as a senior adviser to the president. And though Trump’s adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, apparently will not be serving in any official capacity within their father’s administration, they are nonetheless widely seen as among his closest confidants and are members of his transition team. Already, Trump’s three aforementioned children’s proximity to the   has created significant conflicts of interest. (Trump’s other adult child, Tiffany, does not appear likely to be part of the administration.) Much of this revolves around their father’s professed commitment to resolving issues with his namesake corporation by putting his assets into a trust that will be managed by Donald Jr. and Eric. As I have previously written, though Trump and his supporters have referred to the plan he has described as a blind trust (or, more recently, a “  trust,” which is a thing that doesn’t exist) the children’s   role as advisers to their father means they don’t have nearly enough separation to maintain a true blind trust. (And since so much of Trump’s business derives from real estate and his personal brand, even a real blind trust would not be sufficient to allay concerns about conflicts of interest, as he will retain his knowledge of what those assets are). Additionally, since Trump’s election, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric have all been photographed in meetings that compromise even the illusion of distance from their father’s political dealings. All three appeared in photos of a summit between their father and the leaders of numerous technology companies, as well as a meeting with the   and his Indian business partners. Ivanka and her husband sat in on a meeting between their father and the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, even though Ivanka was at the time negotiating a branding deal with a company owned in part by the Japanese government. Donald Jr. and Eric, who the   has decided will run the business in his stead, have both attended meetings on their father’s behalf. Along with the    problems, all three have drawn criticism for allegedly selling access to the administration through their companies or charitable foundations. After Ivanka appeared on 60 Minutes, her company sent out an advertisement for the $10, 000 bracelet that she wore on air. On December 6, the Eric Trump Foundation initiated an online auction for a chance to have a meeting over coffee with Ivanka as criticism mounted, the foundation removed the web page, though not before the bidding reached more than $70, 000. And both Eric and Donald Jr. were involved in a planned, but ultimately cancelled, charity fundraiser scheduled for the day after their father takes office whose attendees could pay up to $1 million for a private reception with the   as well as a hunting trip with one of his two sons. In the aftermath, Trump announced that Eric would be closing down his foundation to prevent further speculation. Meanwhile, Jared Kushner’s business entanglements also create conflicts with his expected role in the Trump administration. First and foremost, some ethics experts believe that his involvement will trip federal   laws that have been in place since after John F. Kennedy named his brother Robert to the post of attorney general, although Trump’s and Kushner’s lawyers have concluded otherwise. On January 7, just two days before Trump’s transition team confirmed that Kushner would officially be taking a position, The New York Times reported that he has been pursuing a deal with the Chinese financial giant Anbang Insurance to redevelop 666 Fifth Avenue, a centerpiece of his   holdings. Kushner’s brother, Josh Kushner, is a   of the healthcare startup Oscar, which could stand to make millions off of the potential restructuring of the insurance market should Trump pursue repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. According to The New York Times, Kushner’s lawyer has said that he is taking several steps to mitigate conflicts of interest. These include getting rid of his common stocks and his stake in the New York Observer, selling many of his assets to his brother, creating a family trust to be controlled by his mother, and resigning from his role as chief executive of Kushner Companies. Though Kushner is so far taking more active steps than his    has, problems remain. As is the case with Trump’s proposed trust, having a family member administer a trust does not create nearly enough separation to make it truly blind. Moreover, like the  ’s business, many of Kushner’s assets are   simply handing over their operations doesn’t override Kushner’s existing knowledge of what will affect their value, even if he says he will recuse himself from decisions that may affect them. In other words, as with his    conflicts of interest will remain unless Kushner takes more complete steps to distance himself from sources of income that could influence his   in the White House.  Back to table of contents, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, After weeks of speculation and apparent interest in several more conventional possibilities, Trump eventually settled on Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, as his nominee for Secretary of State. Though Tillerson, who has a net worth in the hundreds of millions, is actually among the less wealthy of Trump’s nominees, his position as head of the world’s largest publicly traded international    company has led to questions as to whether he will be able to fully divorce his business interests from his official duties. As is the case with the   he is expected to serve, much of the consternation over Tillerson relates to his apparently unusually copacetic relationship with Vladimir Putin. In fact, according to Steven Coll’s book on the company, Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power, the relationship, which culminated in Tillerson receiving an award called “the Russian Order of Friendship” from Putin, was a key reason Tillerson was chosen as the company’s CEO in 2006. Alexey Pushkov, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russian parliament, weighed in on Tillerson’s nomination on Twitter shortly after it was announced, calling the nomination “a sensation. ” Along with his ties to Putin, Tillerson’s nomination has raised concerns because of Exxon’s complicated relationship with the U. S. government. According to the Financial Times, while Tillerson was in charge of the company, Exxon signed multiple deals with the Russian   oil company Rosneft —  whose chief, Igor Sechin, is considered a member of Putin’s inner circle —  to develop resources in the Black Sea, Siberia, and the Arctic Circle. These developments ceased, however, when the United States sanctioned the Russian oil industry in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014. As could be expected for a person in his position, Tillerson was an active opponent of the U. S.’s sanctions throughout the process after all, the sanctions have prevented Exxon from moving forward with deals reported to be worth billions of dollars. That Tillerson has publicly questioned the utility of sanctions —  and has made at least five visits to the White House since Obama authorized the sanctions —  is in a sense inextricable from his role with Exxon. As Secretary of State, he will have significant sway over those sanctions, which means that he could plausibly pursue a policy that would make his former company billions. So far, Tillerson has taken a number of steps to comply with    rules. According to CNN, Tillerson will be selling off his more than 600, 000 shares in Exxon —  currently valued at more than $54 million —  before taking office. In addition, rather than paying Tillerson his expected retirement package (2 million Exxon shares, valued at more than $181 million, over the next decade) the company will put the value of the retirement package into a blind trust that will not be allowed to invest in the oil company. And should Tillerson return to work in the    industry in the next 10 years, he would forfeit the entire sum. He is also expected to recuse himself from any issue that may affect his former company for his first two years in office. Tillerson’s divestment offers something of a model for future appointees as well as potentially for Trump himself. Though Tillerson, like Trump, has yet to respond to pressure to release his tax returns, he has created an arrangement by which his previous entanglements are sufficiently remote that he can reasonably say they no longer pose a conflict of interest.  Back to table of contents, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Wilbur Ross, Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Commerce, is one of several wealthy businesspeople in Trump’s proposed cabinet. Ross, who Trump called “a champion of American manufacturing” and “one of the greatest negotiators I have met,” is a billionaire investor who made much of his fortune by buying and reselling distressed companies, including those in the steel, coal, and textile industries. Along the way, Ross had a record of outsourcing jobs and slashing benefits for workers at the companies that he took over, as well as for a 2006 explosion at a mine operated by a company he owned. Ross’s financial holdings also create significant conflicts of interest that he will have to navigate before he assumes office. For example, Ross has a stake in, and sits on the board of, ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producer, a company that frequently has a major stake in the Commerce Department’s regulation of the steel industry, including its monitoring of exports, imports, and tariffs. In fact, according to ProPublica, during the first 100 days of Trump’s administration, the Commerce Department is likely to be ruling on investigations into unfair pricing of steel imports from Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy, all of which could significantly affect ArcelorMittal’s profits and stock prices. Ross is also a vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, where he served alongside Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch who Putin recently placed in charge of a major initiative to bring   jobs to Russia and who was once accused of hiring gunmen to take control of a Siberian oil field. Though Ross has stated that he intends to step down from his position, his namesake   firm, WL Ross  Co. will retain its stake in the institution. Beyond the specific entanglements involving ArcelorMittal, Ross’s job as Secretary of Commerce would give him opportunities to advance his general interests in the steel industry: Unless he not only steps down from his position at ArcelorMittal but also sells his stake in the company, Ross will be profiting off of any decision by his own department that makes the company more money. As was noted during the campaign after it was reported that Trump used Chinese steel in some of his development projects, the Department of Commerce recently began a probe into the   Chinese steel industry’s avoidance of American tariffs and use of a “dumping” strategy, in which the Chinese companies undermine the American industry by flooding the market with their product at an artificially low price. As Trump’s commerce secretary, Ross would be in charge of continuing the probe and developing a strategy moving forward, which could be done in a way that makes his own holdings more valuable. So far, representatives of Trump and Ross have dismissed these concerns by comparing Ross’s situation to that of Penny Pritzker, the billionaire businesswoman who has served in the role under President Obama since 2013. In order to comply with the Office of Government Ethics’    rules, Pritzker sold off her stake in more than 200 companies and resigned from her position with Hyatt Ross could conceivably do the same and put his resulting assets in a blind trust. Until he does so, his billions in holdings and industry involvement could influence, or at the very least be seen as influencing, his   in office.  Back to table of contents, Secretary of Labor Andy Puzder, Andy Puzder, Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Labor, is one of Trump’s many nominees with a history of antagonism toward the very body he will soon be leading. As the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which owns the   chains Carl’s Jr. and Hardees, Puzder developed a long track record of opposition to   and overtime rules and   policies he also characterized the department’s policies under President Obama and current leader Tom Perez as “deterrence by ‘gotcha’ enforcement. ” Along with his antipathy toward the department, Puzder would bring to the position significant financial entanglements that could threaten his ability to discharge his duties in office. Among the Department of Labor’s duties is investigating claims of     violations and occupational safety hazards.   chains are frequent targets of such claims during Puzder’s tenure at CKE, the Labor Department investigated allegations of wage theft and other problems at several Hardee’s franchises, finding violations in nearly 60% of cases. Complicating matters is the fact that such actions typically target the individual franchisees rather than parent companies like CKE. According to Bloomberg, of the 108 investigations into   stores since 2004, only six were at   restaurants, none of which yielded a fineable violation. When Puzder first emerged as a possible candidate for the position, a source close to him suggested that, since 94 percent of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurants are franchises not directly operated by CKE, Puzder may not have to recuse himself from his company in order to carry out his duties as Secretary of Labor. However, as is true for the   himself, simply being uninvolved in the    operation of a profitable enterprise does not resolve conflicts of interest. The problem is not Puzder’s level of control over CKE and its individual franchises but the fact that he makes money off of a company that frequently comes into conflict with the very department that he will soon be heading, which could create perverse incentives to pursue policies against the interests of the company’s employees or the general public. As such, it remains an open question how Puzder will distance himself from CKE to avoid the possibility that his role with the company will interfere with his potential role in the Trump administration.

53384,73586,Will States Take Up the Mantle of Worker Protection?,Atlantic,Bourree Lam,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"Since November’s election, labor advocates have been bracing themselves for an administration they fear will be kinder to owners than to workers. One of the clearest signs that the Department of Labor is set to switch gears: Andy Puzder, the CEO of   company CKE Restaurants, was nominated as secretary of the Labor Department. Puzder has been an outspoken critic of some of the changes labor advocates are currently trying to implement such as   increases and expanded overtime pay, arguing that such regulations hinder businesses and lead them to hire less. But some are hopeful that there’s another way to protect employees, even without the federal government’s help: Instead, they’re looking to the states. One of the leaders on this at the state level will Eric Schneiderman, the Democratic attorney general of New York, who has been active in pushing for increased worker protections in his state. He has helped end   scheduling —  the practice in which shift workers are called in on short notice, or prevented from working scheduled shifts on slow days —  at major retailers, including J. Crew, Disney, and Aeropostale. Schneiderman has been credited for rallying attorneys general in other states in joint actions on labor and employment issues. In the case of   scheduling, the investigation involved attorney general offices in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Rhode Island, and D. C. “The Constitution preserves lots of power at the state level   …     so we do have this federalist system that enables us to provide protections at the state level when the federal government falls down on the job,” said Schneiderman in an interview. Now, in light of the changes coming to the federal government, Schneiderman believes that the role of states will be all the more critical for workplace issues and regulations. “It’s clear that we’re going to have a vigorous national debate about some stuff that I would have thought would have been settled a while ago but apparently open for discussion again regarding wages and overtime,” said Schneiderman. “Our labor bureau has been very successful in all of these areas, and we’re set up to enforce the law and protect New Yorkers and take on the debate if the incoming Labor Secretary really does want to follow through on what I think are some harmful public policies to try to reduce wages, overtime, and worker protections. ” States that have the manpower can be very effective in helping workers recover lost wages. One area where state action may prove effective is wage theft, which affects both   and   workers. Workers lose out on wages for work they’ve done in a variety of ways, such as when employers don’t pay overtime to those legally entitled to it, or force workers to work off the clock, or collude to keep pay down. On the part of attorneys general, the shift of enforcement power from the federal government to the states could require their offices to more regularly initiate investigations, file lawsuits, and bring employers to the table for dispute settlement. “If they’re actually going to be attacking vulnerable populations such as low wage workers, we stand ready to defend them. And if they are going to violate any of their statutory or constitutional duties, we’re prepared to challenge them in court,” said Schneiderman. States have found themselves in this position before. “Under the Bush administration the Department of Labor also did not focus on fierce and aggressive protection of workers,” said Terri Gerstein, an incoming fellow of the Open Society Foundation and the former labor bureau chief in the New York State Attorney General’s Office. “There was much more of a focus on education of employers and compliance assistance. In enforcement, there’s always a series of decisions to be made . .. if decisions are made in favor of weak enforcement, that’s a situation that we’ve seen before. ” But it’s not as though states took a backseat during the Obama administration. Some states took on an increased role in handling wage and labor practices, with a growing number of have passed their own minimum wage and   laws. Seven states —  California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont, and most recently Arizona and Washington —  now have laws requiring paid sick leave. Minimum wage went up in 21 states and 22 cities at the start of this year. For labor advocates, the concern about this approach is what happens to people in states that are less adamant about enforcement. While workers in states that have been active on these issues in the past —  such as California, Connecticut, Illinois, and Massachusetts to name a few —  will likely continue to be protected by their state agencies, states without established resources in place will have a harder time stepping up in the same way. In Georgia, for example, there is no   enforcement process, and wage claims are filed directly to the Department of Labor. “It’s far from ideal, if this ends up happening,” says Tsedeye Gebreselassie, an attorney at the National Employment Law Project. “The way that this should be done is that the federal Department of Labor remains an effective recourse for workers whose rights have been violated, not just on minimum wage but all the federal laws that the Department of Labor enforces. But then you also have states there too as another avenue through which workers can recover their unpaid wages. ” Additionally, though states can play a key role on some employment issues, there are workplace issues that require federal enforcement. ”States can play a tremendously important role in combating wage theft, but in other critical areas, like workplace safety and health or workers’ right to organize, states may have a harder time filling in the gap because they are often preempted by federal law from directly enforcing these laws,” says Gerstein. “To me, there’s no question that it’s federalism from below,” says Janice Fine, an associate professor and labor expert at Rutgers University’s School of Management and Labor Relations. Fine has been studying how states and localities think about enforcement, and while she’s concerned about states with less enforcement, she’s found that there can be see creative solutions. She cites the example of the Fair Food Standards Council in Florida, a labor group which won over companies on fair work conditions and now acts as a private enforcement agency to protect farmers on health, safety and wage issues, as well as the work of the Workers Defense Project in Texas, which has notably pushed through a bill that makes it easier for police departments across Texas to arrest employers engaging in wage theft. A    approach means that worker protection becomes less an American project, and more a feature of the particular place one lives. And for workers who don’t live in the states that will fill in where the federal government leaves off, that could mean many American workers not getting paid what they’re owed."
53385,73587,The (Final) Problem With Sherlock,Atlantic,Sophie Gilbert,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"This story contains spoilers through the most recent episode of Sherlock. Christopher Nolan is a truly brilliant British creative talent, which makes it all the more ironic that his work seems to have (at least temporarily) unmoored two of that nation’s greatest fictional heroes. In dampening the palette and tone of superhero movies so spectacularly with his trilogy of Batman movies, Nolan created a domino effect that stretched all the way across the ocean, transforming James Bond from a louche, debonair intelligence agent into a tortured,   hitman, compelled by the death of his parents to hunt down a series of increasingly psychopathic villains. And, as “The Final Problem” revealed on Sunday, Nolan’s influence has similarly transformed Sherlock. A wry detective drama with a twist has turned into a superhero origin story, complete with agonizing childhood trauma, terrifying antagonists with improbable powers, and a final showdown in an ancestral home burned to the ground. Mark Gatiss, who   Sherlock with Steven Moffat, and who   “The Final Problem,” in addition to playing Sherlock’s brother, Mycroft, has hinted before that Sherlock exists in the same fictional universe as James Bond. At the end of season three, Mycroft defends his brother by saying, “As my colleague is fond of remarking, this country sometimes needs a blunt instrument. ” The comment alludes to “M,” the head of MI6, who once derided James Bond using the same language, but it also seems to explain what made the fourth season of Sherlock such a mess. Sherlock Holmes is anything but a blunt instrument: He’s the embodiment of brains defeating brawn of observation and intellect, not firepower, saving the realm. The last three episodes of Sherlock, by contrast, have obsessed over their hero’s emotional and intellectual vulnerabilities, and in doing so have lost touch with what made the show so dazzling to begin with. The Troublesome Women of Sherlock, It’s a problem that seems to have begun with Mary (Amanda Abbington) introduced as John Watson’s fiancée in season three in “The Empty Hearse,” but then unmasked as a former superspy and freelance assassin in “His Last Vow. ” That revelation tipped Sherlock from heightened realism into implausible,   inspired fantasy, complete with a grotesque villain holed up in an architecturally splendid hideaway. The most ingenious scenes in that season showed Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) retreating into his mind palace to reason his way through a series of  . But, in the end, brawn triumphed. Sherlock, unable to defeat a tyrannical media baron through brainpower alone, shot him in the head, declaring himself to be a “  sociopath” in order to justify the act. The moment seemed to crystallize Sherlock’s evolution (Mycroft’s “blunt instrument” comments came in a scene not long after). And season four’s three episodes have doubled down, focusing largely on the tribulations of the show’s main characters and nodding only occasionally at intriguing puzzles. It’s no coincidence that “The Lying Detective” was the best work of the season —  it was the only episode that actually presented Sherlock with a substantial case, namely a monstrous millionaire moonlighting as a serial killer. By contrast, “The Six Thatchers” dealt almost entirely with Mary’s past before dispatching her to provide narrative trauma for Sherlock and John (Martin Freeman) while “The Final Problem” was a climactic mess, seemingly indulging the writers’ instincts to have a lark, consistency be damned. “You got a lot of actual plot for your entrance fee,” Moffat told Entertainment Weekly. “The final sequence running around trying to stop a plane crash, trying to solve a puzzle, and John Watson drowning  —   I just thought it was breakneck and fun. ” I wrote two weeks ago about being disappointed with Mary’s death, and wondering why such a brilliant show has such problems fitting intriguing female characters into its universe. The emergence of Eurus (Sian Brooke) as Sherlock’s secret sister in “The Lying Detective” seemed to signal how wrong this was, but the Eurus of “The Final Problem” was somehow a completely different character still: a bizarre mashup of the supernatural monster Samara in The Ring and Javier Bardem’s Raoul Silva, a wronged former ally intent on revenge, in Skyfall. Eurus, who played three distinct characters convincingly in a previous episode, was suddenly a horror cliché with lank black hair and dead eyes, using mind control to compel others to do awful things, and plotting extravagant riddles for her brother that put his friends in mortal danger. Things got weaker still when the action suddenly shifted to Sherlock, Mycroft, and Eurus’s childhood home, a pile of stones as stately as Skyfall or Wayne Manor (both of those, you’ll remember, also ended up being obliterated by baddies bearing grudges). John, trapped in a well, discovered the bones of a child (another echo of The Ring) which led Sherlock to discover another memory he’d suppressed, along with any awareness of his sister. Decades ago Eurus, jealous of Sherlock’s closeness with his best friend, Victor, trapped Victor in a well and gave Sherlock a puzzle that would lead to him. But Sherlock couldn’t solve the riddle, Victor died, and Sherlock’s tormented psyche reimagined Victor as “Redbeard,” a dog, while also prompting him to shut down the human side of his personality and clinically investigate crimes for the rest of his life as penance. It was an episode that resisted attempts to make sense of it. Why did Eurus disguise herself and offer Sherlock clues to a case he was investigating, not to mention disguise herself and try to seduce John Watson? If she managed to escape Sherrinford, the   island fort where she’d been imprisoned for most of her life, why go back to her cell? Why would she compel Moriarty five years ago to record thousands of convenient gifs and soundbites for a larger plan to get revenge on her brothers but then do nothing when Moriarty forced Sherlock to commit suicide in “The Reichenbach Fall”? Rather than illuminate the complex fabric of the show, as good series finales do, “The Final Problem” poked holes in it, pulling any threads of narrative consistency apart. It also seemed to conclusively bring Sherlock to an end, complete with a voiceover from the   Mary essentially declaring that everyone lived happily ever after. Given that it took three years just to get a fourth season, thanks to the stratospheric rise of the show’s stars and their increasingly clogged schedules, it’s fair to assume that new episodes will be a long time coming, if they ever materialize. And, with the direction the show’s taken, it’s easier to say goodbye to it than it might have been a month ago. Modern culture is saturated with superheroes and their nemeses and their gadgets and their secret pain. But Sherlock, at its best, was unlike anything else on air: a celebration of a hero whose primary motivation was simply thinking things through."
53386,73588,Trump’s Last Vacant Cabinet Post,Atlantic,Molly Ball,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"Three days before Donald Trump is to be inaugurated as America’s new president, just one Cabinet agency lacks a nominee to lead it: the Department of Agriculture. The pick has become mired in politics and drama, unsettling the agriculture industry and potentially imperiling Trump’s standing with some of his most ardent supporters —  the residents of rural America. In the process, it has become a case study in the difficulty Trump will face as he begins to govern, as his sweeping promises and catchy slogans run up against competing interests. Already, the delay in picking an agriculture secretary has caused alarm. “The lack of quick and decisive action on picking a new Secretary of Agriculture by the Trump administration has given rise to charges that agriculture is not a high priority for the incoming president,” columnist Gary Truitt wrote recently in Hoosier Ag Today. “While this may or may not be true, the fact that this was the last cabinet post to be filled has raised concerns and will produce some challenges for the new nominee. ” More than two weeks ago, multiple news outlets reported that Trump was set to pick Sonny Perdue to lead the Agriculture Department, or USDA. Perdue, a former governor of Georgia, is well regarded in agriculture circles. A former veterinarian who grew up on a farm and owns agribusiness holdings, and the cousin of U. S. Senator David Perdue, Sonny Perdue is an immigration hawk who once led lawmakers in a prayer for rain during a drought. But Perdue has not been announced for the post, and Trump has continued to receive a parade of other contenders. When he named David Shulkin to head veterans affairs last week, USDA became the last unfilled Cabinet position. After Perdue’s appointment was floated, reports indicated that the Trump team wanted to pick a woman or Hispanic for the position instead, in order to add diversity to the Cabinet. Elsa Murano, the former president of Texas AM, and Abel Maldonado, former lieutenant governor of California, have been prominently mentioned. Both have experience with agriculture: Murano, an expert on food safety, was a USDA undersecretary under George W. Bush, while Maldonado is the child of immigrant farmworkers and owns a vineyard. But the idea that the administration might use the USDA post to “balance” the overwhelmingly white and male Cabinet has sparked controversy in agricultural circles. “I would say there has been anguish,” Gary Baise, a D. C. lawyer who helped Trump marshal rural and agricultural support during the campaign, told me. “Agriculture is too important to use as a dumping ground for political correctness. ” Baise and others warn that Trump owes a debt to rural voters, from among whom he drew his strongest support in the election. They are not the only ones affected by agricultural policy, of course —  everybody eats, and more than 40 million   Americans rely on the food stamps the USDA administers. But agriculture, from family farmers to big agribusiness, looms especially large in the landscape, economy, and culture of rural areas. And rural voters went overwhelmingly for Trump. His   margin over Hillary Clinton among voters in rural areas was 7 points better than Mitt Romney’s margin over Barack Obama four years ago. Many commentators have seen the election’s outcome as the result of a    divide between rural and urban America. “Rural America would be really disappointed,” Baise said, if Trump is seen as not keeping faith with the agricultural community. The smart money is still on Trump picking Perdue, according to Baise, a   Republican   veteran who helped Trump assemble his agriculture advisory team. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. A source in Perdue’s orbit said he still wants the job and is mystified by the delay. For now, the ag world watches and waits for an agriculture secretary to be named. On Friday night, they will gather at Washington’s Grand Hyatt for a   inaugural ball —  the “Piggy Prom” —  formally known as the Inaugural Gala Celebrating American Agriculture. But the difficulty for Trump won’t end once he chooses a USDA head. Farmers and farm experts are also wary of some of his signature policy promises. As the top ag journalist Jerry Hagstrom wrote recently in National Journal Daily, “The selection of Agriculture secretary may be simple in comparison with figuring out both the right policies and the right politics for rural America and agriculture. ” Trade is one flash point: Trump’s protectionist proclamations run counter to agricultural producers’ reliance on export markets. The American Farm Bureau Federation strongly backed the   Partnership, which Trump vocally opposed. Trump has decried the U. S.’s yawning trade deficit with China, but agriculture is the rare sector in which the U. S. enjoys a China trade surplus —  exports to China are currently the only thing keeping soybean prices afloat. Tariffs or a trade war with China could hurt American farmers’ bottom line. “Rural America turned out for Trump,” a top agribusiness lobbyist told me. “But now their pocketbooks could be on the chopping block. ” (Ag watchers were encouraged, however, by Trump’s tapping of Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to serve as ambassador to China.) Immigration is another tricky area: Agriculture relies on foreign workers, from crop pickers to   workers, and the farm lobby has been advocating for years for immigration reform that protects and increases the flow of such workers. If the Trump administration seeks to deport the millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the U. S. to reduce legal immigration levels, or to eliminate   programs, agriculture would be hit hard. Finally, agricultural observers are closely watching a series of pending mergers in Big Ag, such as the proposed purchase of St.   seed giant Monsanto by the German company Bayer. Trump met with the CEOs of Bayer and Monsanto last week, a meeting the executives called “productive. ” On Tuesday, the Trump transition team announced that the companies had committed to billions in    spending and thousands of U. S. jobs if the merger is approved. But some of Trump’s big agricultural backers oppose such proposed mergers, including Bruce Rastetter, an Iowa agribusiness mogul and prominent Republican donor. “It’s wrong for U. S. agriculture and really farmers around the world, this consolidation,” Rastetter told the Wall Street Journal. His public criticisms have attracted wide notice in the ag world. Whether deals like the   merger —  the purchase of a major U. S. company by a foreign buyer —  are approved under Trump is being closely watched. “That decision will be huge in sending a signal to the agriculture community, which is very leery of that kind of concentration,” Baise, the D. C. ag lawyer, told me. If Trump goes down the “wrong track” with agriculture personnel and policy, there could be political consequences, he said: “He should be very concerned that American agriculture might rise up against him. ”"
53387,73589,What ’Brexit Means Brexit’ Means,Atlantic,Krishnadev Calamur,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"British Prime Minister Theresa May laid out in the clearest terms yet the government’s vision for a   U. K. saying she hopes to have the best deal possible for free trade with the European Union, but one that “will ensure we can control immigration to Britain from Europe. ” Although May’s remarks offered little in terms of policy specifics, they should put to rest any speculation the British government would somehow reverse the results of the Brexit referendum. The message from May was clear: Britons voted last June to leave the EU and the government would deliver on that demand. May, who said in June that “Brexit means Brexit,” said the U. K. won’t seek access to the European single market will control immigration from Europe and seek   deals with the EU and beyond. She also warned the EU against taking punitive actions against the U. K. for leaving the bloc, saying it “would be an act of calamitous   for the countries of Europe. ” Before any of this, though, the U. K. must invoke Article 50 of the EU charter, the step by which it can begin official talks to leave the EU. May is expected to do that in March. Talks with the EU are expected to take two years, during which the two sides will negotiate what the U. K.’s future relationship with the EU will look like. May said any final deal with the EU would be put before Parliament for a vote. In her remarks, May spoke of Britain’s relationship with Europe and beyond. “We are a European country —  and proud of our shared European heritage,” she said. “But we are also a country that has always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. ” She said a strong EU was in the U. K.’s interests, but urged the bloc to heed the lessons from her country’s impending exit. She said the EU “bends toward uniformity, not flexibility,” adding its inflexibility on matters important to the U. K. contributed to the Leave vote. “Britain is not the only member state where there is a strong attachment to accountable and democratic government, such a strong internationalist mindset, or a belief that diversity within Europe should be celebrated,” she said. “And so I believe there is a lesson in Brexit not just for Britain but, if it wants to succeed, for the EU itself. ” Brexit, May said, would mean an end to the jurisdiction over the U. K. of the European Court of Justice, which rules on disputes between member states and ensures European law is interpreted the same way across the bloc allow the government to “control immigration to Britain from Europe,” and a stop annual contributions to the EU budget. But, she added, the U. K. would seek to ensure “the rights of EU citizens who are already living in Britain, and the rights of British nationals in other member states, as early as we can. ” May said the U. K. was “leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe. ” But she was also clear about her country’s future relationship with the bloc: The U. K. did not want “partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us    .   …     No, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. And my job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do. ” Supporters of Britain’s continued membership in the EU —  and indeed even some politicians who supported leaving —  have floated arrangements such as those enjoyed by Norway, which is not an EU member, but gets some of the same benefits as member states. May said the U. K. would pursue a new   agreement with the bloc, but will not seek access to the European single market. That issue of has perhaps been the   obstacle to a smooth Brexit even before the process has been set in motion. The EU says it won’t consider   access for the U. K. unless it accepts the “four freedoms” —  goods, capital, services, and people. And because the UK wants to limit the number of migrants coming to its territory,   membership appears to be a nonstarter —  even though Brexit proponents such as Boris Johnson, now the UK foreign minister, had said the UK would remain a member of the single market. May said any agreement with the EU “should allow for the freest possible trade in goods and services between Britain and the EU’s member states. It should give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate within European markets —  and let European businesses do the same in Britain. ” Judging by what May appears to be asking for —  access to the single market in all but name —  that might prove a contentious point during negotiations. The U. K. May added, would also pursue   deals with other nations. She noted that contrary to President Obama, who warned that the U. K. would move to the “back of the queue” on a trade deal with the U. S. if it voted to leave the EU,   Trump noted Britain is not “at the back of the queue   …     but front of the line. ” May also warned European officials against trying to punish the U. K. for leaving the EU, saying any such move “would be an act of calamitous   for the countries of Europe. ” She said “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal,” because it would still allow the country to trade with Europe and strike trade deals across the world. But for the EU, she said, among other things it “would mean a loss of access for European firms to the financial services of the City of London. ”"
53388,73590,The New Celebrity Apprentice and the Scourge of Faux Inclusivity,Atlantic,Megan Garber,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"This post contains mild revelations about the results of season 15 of The New Celebrity Apprentice. “We now live in an inclusive society where no one’s left out,” Boy George announced during Monday evening’s episode of The New Celebrity Apprentice. He shared this piece of good news while describing the series of ads he and his team had developed on behalf of Kawasaki’s new line of ergonomically customizable motorcycles. “The idea of this campaign,” the Culture Club singer explained to Arnold Schwarzenegger, The New Celebrity Apprentice’s recently installed new host, “was that, you know, anybody can be a biker —  not just the traditional person who uses the bike. It’s open to everyone, whatever their sexuality, whatever their age, whatever their gender. And I think that was a really, really positive message. ” A positive message it was. And in response to it, Schwarzenegger replied: “Good. ” The       added no more to the conversation. Instead, he went on to fire (or, this being Schwarzenegger, to “terminate”) Kyle Richards, the Real Housewife who had been the project manager for the women’s team. Her firing came partially because the campaign the women had created for Kawasaki had failed to do enough to subvert traditional gender roles. At least, it had failed to do that in Schwarzenegger’s judgment, which is, in the show’s executivecentric universe, the only judgment that matters. It was all, on the surface, a rousing endorsement of diversity and inclusion —  a reality show, just as Boy George suggested, serving as a metaphor for reality itself. And it was unsurprising that the show would do that: The New Celebrity Apprentice, like so many of its fellow reality shows, is extremely skilled at making pageantry out of progress. And the newly Schwarzeneggered version of the show, to its credit, offers many of the same things the   iteration did: an equal number of women contestants and men, of various ethnicities and backgrounds a general focus not on contestants’ appearance, but on what they bring to the table an opening montage that emphasizes moral extraversion by asking, in all caps, “WHAT IF   …     YOU COULD   …     MAKE A DIFFERENCE?” The initial episodes of Schwarzenegger’s version of The Celebrity Apprentice divided season 15’s contestants by gender, pitting men and women against each other and implying, in the process, that both groups are equally fit to compete in the only competition the show respects: the dogged pursuit of money (money, money, money,  ). The People Behind The Apprentice Owe America the Truth About Donald Trump, There are many, many criticisms you can make of The Celebrity Apprentice both as a franchise and a phenomenon, only some of them connected to the show’s   only some others of them related to the man who was once the show’s host and who still serves, in a major ethical breach, as its executive producer. One argument in the show’s favor, however, is that it treats celebrity as the only currency that matters. In that very particular way, and despite its many absurdities, The New Celebrity Apprentice, which is not a ratings juggernaut but which is a show that airs during primetime on a major TV network, could be a productive force: It could model for its viewers the precise kind of society Boy George was describing in his speech. One broad argument for capitalism, after all, is that it is, as a system, less concerned with a person’s race or gender or age or appearance or sexual orientation than it is with that person’s ability to make money. The New Celebrity Apprentice, say what else you will about it, subscribes to this kind of brute egalitarianism. But: It does so only on the most superficial of levels. The New Celebrity Apprentice’s sense of inclusion is perfectly attenuated to its genre: It offers “reality” that too often fails to be, well, reality. Boy George made his declaration about the “we” who “now live in an inclusive society” during the same week that will see the inauguration of a man who has publicly mocked the notion of inclusivity itself —  a man who was propelled to the presidency with the help of the very show in which the “Karma Chameleon” singer was participating. The New Celebrity Apprentice champions diversity while often, at the same time, questioning its value. And, often, in the manner of its former host, outright mocking it. Take Monday’s episode. Kawasaki, like many of the show’s previous advertisers (Tyra Banks cosmetics, Trident gum, Welch’s grape juice, King’s Hawaiian barbecue sauce) asked the celebrity contestants to design an ad campaign that would reflect their aspirations to expand their market. The brand, its executives told the contestants, wants to sell to women. It wants to sell to people of all shapes and sizes, not just to the biker dudes of tradition and cliché. And the men’s team, under the project managership of the TV personality Carson Kressley, responded to the request with an   fashion shoot featuring several celebrities —  the drag queen Alaska   the comedian Jon Lovitz dressed as a priest, the Motley Crue frontman Vince Neil posing with his puppy, the former football player Ricky Williams posing with a cigar, Kressley  posing in the nude —  astride a Kawasaki bike. The resulting images were meant to suggest the very thing Boy George claimed they did: diversity, idiosyncrasy, comfort in one’s own skin. The notion that “anybody can be a biker. ” The women, as has been the case in many of the new season’s challenges, had a harder time. They did their photo shoot in downtown LA, featuring themselves —  the boxing champion Laila Ali, the basketball champion Lisa Leslie, Kyle Richards, Real Housewife Porsha Williams —  posing on the bikes, in an effort to celebrate women’s empowerment. The actor and TV host Brooke   enlisted the help of her husband, the former Baywatch star David Charvet, to pose with her on the bike —  the idea being that she would be driving, with him in the back, because 2017 and women’s power and all that. Charvet, however, adamantly refused. The man who would agree to be driven by his wife, he informed his wife, angrily, “is a stupid guy. That’s a stupid husband. ” (“You’re not gonna look wimpy, because I’m a great driver!”   said, further trying to convince him. Charvet responded, “Are you out of your tree? I would never trust you. ”) Later, in a   interview,   tried to apologize for her husband: “He’s very macho,” she said apologetically, “and he’s not the most cooperative guy. ” And he really is not: The Charvets ended up doing the photo shoot with David in the driver’s seat of the Kawasaki, his wife clutching his midsection. The photo that resulted was pretty it was not, however, terribly celebratory of the empowerment of women. For that,   almost got kicked off the show. For that, too, Richards got fired. That it all played out as it did would seem to suggest that the show wanted   in the driver’s seat, with all that that implies. And so would the exchange about the photo that took place in the board room. “He could have just asked me to sit on the back of the bike,” Schwarzenegger told  . “I would have been more than happy. I have no qualms about it —  to look feminine sitting on the back of a motorcycle with a woman. ” “You would’ve gotten on the back of the bike?”   asked, incredulously. “Yes, absolutely,” Schwarzenegger replied. “Any time. For a photo —  for selling something like this, I would do it in two seconds. ”   still incredulous, followed up. “And what about in real life? Would you have let me drive you on the back of a motorcycle?” Schwarzenegger seemed to sense a trap. A look of discomfort crossed his face. “Absolutely. I would sit in the back of your bike,” he replied. “Of course I would  …    ” His voice trailed off, awkwardly. They moved on. There was The New Celebrity Apprentice in a nice, if awkward, nutshell: the performance of egalitarianism, pitted against the reality of it. For a photo, I would play the woman’s part. For selling something, I would do it in two seconds. When the issue is “real life,” however, the swagger switches to uncertainty. When things get real, “looking feminine” by being a passenger on a motorcycle is much less appealing for the man at the center of The New Celebrity Apprentice. The “reality”   disconnect repeated itself several more times during Monday’s episode. There was, on the one hand, Kressley describing his team’s work like so: “Everyone was coming together in a spirit of love and togetherness. It’s a bike to remove barriers, and you should feel like you’re included, and it’s everyone’s bike. Anything’s possible. Everyone’s welcome. ” And then there was on the other the MMA star Chael Sonnen, who was a part of that team, saying in a   interview, “At some point the governor’s gonna say to me, ‘Did you have anything to do with the gay man and the drag queen on the motorcycle?’ And I’m gonna say, ‘Governor, what do you think? ’” There was Lovitz, watching Kressley’s nude photo shoot and making jokes about Purell. There he was again, caught by the show’s camera holding hands with Kressley as the men’s team reviewed the results of their photo shoot —  and then saying to the former Queer Eye star, “Let’s not hold hands too long. ” There was Kressley, narrating the campaign meant to celebrate society’s having surpassed its stereotypes, explaining one of the images the team created with this: “She’s the typical girl. She loves to shop. ” Again and again: The words, colliding against the reality. The pageantry of inclusion, proven, behind the scenes, to be messy and chaotic. In that, The New Celebrity Apprentice is a kind of metaphor, just as Boy George suggested —  not necessarily for an inclusive society, but for a Hollywood that still struggles, so obviously, with representing America in all its shades and stripes. The New Celebrity Apprentice is a show that professes equality between men and women, but is hosted by a man who was accused, in 2003, of sexually harassing six different women. Here is a show that used to be hosted by a man who bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy” —  and who, in a 2013 board room conversation, commented to contestant Brande Roderick that “it must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees. ” The Apprentice is a franchise that tries to have it both ways —  in many, many ways —  not just when it comes to its   political conflicts, but also when it comes to the broader project of modeling social progress. It knows what it wants to be repeatedly, it falls short of fulfilling that desire. That’s the problem with reality TV: Sooner or later, it’s going to have to reconcile with reality."
53389,73591,Will Hollywood Learn From Hidden Figures’s Success?,Atlantic,David Sims,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"Hidden Figures has been the breakout film of 2017 thus far. Starring three African American women (played by Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monáe, and Octavia Spencer) it focuses on an unheralded piece of American history: the work of black female mathematicians and engineers at NASA in the 1960s. Released to strong reviews, Hidden Figures seems destined for a few Academy Award nominations next week. Since it expanded nationwide, it has spent two weeks at the top of the box office, ahead of   films like Monster Trucks, Patriots Day, Live By Night, and Oscar frontrunner La La Land. Made for a comparatively small $25 million, the film is essentially guaranteed to gross at least $100 million in the United States alone, posting a very healthy profit for its studio, 20th Century Fox. The viewing public’s desire for a film like Hidden Figures is indisputable. So why does Hollywood make so few of them? In 2015, only 32 of the top 100 films at the box office featured a female lead or   only three of those leads were women of color, and almost half of them did not feature a black female character in any capacity. After having an   slate of acting nominees for two years in a row (spurring the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite) the Academy is trying to diversify its voting body with the hope of rewarding a broader selection of films. But Hollywood at large is showing few traces of change. Last year’s most successful films, largely superhero sequels and animated blockbusters, lack for variety in their storytelling. The slow nature of film production means it can take years to really reflect a shift in studio thinking, but Hidden Figures still feels (disappointingly) like an anomaly rather than a sign of a real transformation. That said, it wouldn’t be hard for major studios to increase the number of films written by women: The ratio in 2015 was 69 percent male to 31 percent female, but by commissioning just five new scripts by women per year, things would be equal by 2018. But the supposed “surprise” of Hidden Figures’s success feels especially galling because it repeats a similar conversation from a year ago. Films like Creed and Straight Outta Compton were smash hits, clearly refuting the discriminatory maxim that films about people of color are more of a   risk for studios. A year later, Hidden Figures is “disproving” that trend yet again —  even though that kind of backwards thinking about diversity should feel entirely irrelevant by now. In its first weekend of wide release, Hidden Figures defied tracking numbers that saw it grossing less than the fourth weekend of Rogue One it made $22 million, also beating out that week’s new blockbuster, Underworld: Brood Wars. For the subsequent   Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday weekend, Hidden Figures actually increased its gross, making $26 million and staying at number one, holding off the expansion of La La Land, the horror film The Bye Bye Man, and Paramount’s   children’s adventure Monster Trucks. That last film provides a particularly interesting lesson in Hollywood economics. The industry, in general, has focused in recent years on films that have the potential to be launching pads for major franchises. As the movie business becomes more globally focused and tries to compete with TVs that can offer a    viewing experience at home, splashy   extravaganzas have become a routine matter of course. This is frequently put forward as an explanation for why Hollywood seems loath to cast actors of color in leading roles, because they supposedly have less market pull worldwide (an argument soundly disproven by hits like the Fast  Furious franchise or Star Wars: The Force Awakens, as well as many   films). And yet Monster Trucks is a patently silly piece of kids entertainment about a young man who finds a   monster living in his truck. It stars Lucas Till, hardly an   (though he had a small role in the recent   movies) and cost $125 million to make —  $100 million more than Hidden Figures. Devoting such a large budget to a film with little brand recognition that was basically guaranteed to get terrible reviews was quickly regarded as a disastrous decision. Viacom, the company that owns the Monster Trucks studio Paramount Pictures, took a $115 million   in earnings last September in anticipation of its failure (it opened to a lackluster $15 million last weekend). This is what Hollywood’s emphasis on   films with “broad appeal” inevitably leads to: hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on   action films with no real audience. For the cost of Monster Trucks, Paramount could have made five Hidden Figures —  smaller films, focused on telling grounded stories to fill a market gap that studios continue to ignore. That Hidden Figures’s success has to serve as a lesson to Hollywood in 2017 is ridiculous, but the lesson is nonetheless there to be learned. Audiences are hungry for films that look beyond the movie industry’s narrow worldview. It’s time to start delivering them."
53390,73593,The Spies Who Love Putin,Atlantic,Mark Galeotti,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"It’s tempting to look to the playbooks and historical traditions of the late Soviet Union to explain the audacity of today’s Russian intelligence activity, from its meddling in U. S. elections, to apparently killing Kremlin opponents abroad. But these activities are not just products of old ways or new geopolitics. They also stem from a shift in the activities of Russia’s political police force, the infamous Federal Security Service (FSB). Originally established to protect the Kremlin’s rule at home, it has increasingly moved into Russia’s foreign operations. A new cohort of secret policemen, ignorant of the traditions of spycraft and secure in Putin’s protection, has fundamentally altered the nature of Russian intelligence. The FSB stands accused not just of engineering the leaks against Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, but also backing extremist parties in Europe, stirring up discontent among   minorities in the Baltic, allegedly murdering Chechen opposition leaders in Turkey and Austria, spreading disinformation, and even kidnapping an Estonian security officer across the border in 2014. And according to the infamous unverified dossier published by Buzzfeed on January 10, it also collected compromising information on Trump with the suspected aim of turning him into Vladimir Putin’s puppet. One has to go back to Soviet times for such a rich array of proven and suspected covert adventures abroad. The Biggest Intelligence Questions Raised by the Trump Dossier, By allowing the FSB to move into foreign intelligence and covert operations, though, Putin has —  probably inadvertently —  unleashed a beast. The FSB is playing a central role in current developments not because it possesses greater technical capabilities than the other Russian agencies, but because, for the most part, it does not recognize or respect the same limitations as the rest of Russia’s security services. To put it crudely, the FSB does the kinds of things everyone else thinks about doing but doesn’t because they’re too risky, too politically inflammatory, or too likely to backfire. The FSB is just the latest,   iteration of the old Soviet KGB. In one of his many toxic legacies, former Russian President Boris Yeltsin ignored calls to disband an institution that appeared beyond repair and rebuild it from scratch. Instead, after 1991, he opted to partition the KGB. Its first chief directorate, responsible for espionage, was simply rebranded as the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Most of the directorates tasked with domestic security were gathered together first under the umbrella of the Ministry of Security, then the Federal   Service, and, in 1995, the FSB. Since then, the FSB has not looked back, especially after 1998, when for a brief time it was headed by a     officer whose career was about to experience an unexpected boost —  one Vladimir Putin. In the years since, the FSB has been one his staunchest allies, hounding and discrediting his rivals, looking after his underlings, and clamping down on any spasms of popular protest. In return, he has shielded, empowered, and elevated the agency, turning a blind eye to corruption in its ranks, allowing it to   rival agencies such as the Federal   Service (Russia’s equivalent to the DEA, which was abolished in 2016) and giving its officers key positions, from regional governorships to head of his security council. Traditionally, Putin controlled Russia’s sprawling bureaucracy by creating multiple, overlapping agencies, that he would then play off against each other. This is especially evident within the intelligence community. In Ukraine, for example, the SVR, FSB, and GRU, the military intelligence agency, all ran competing operations. When former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was toppled by the “Euromaidan” revolution in 2014, catching Moscow by surprise, the result was a hurried game of   . Although the FSB had been the agency most closely associated with Yanukovych and had argued most forcefully that he would survive, it enjoyed Putin’s support, and so the SVR wound up taking the blame for the intelligence failure. One result of the agencies fighting over the same turf has been the increasing intrusion of the FSB into foreign operations. In 2003, the agency absorbed most of the electronic eavesdropping and   capabilities of FAPSI, Russia’s equivalent of the NSA. In 2005, it began operating in   neighboring states. In 2006, Russia passed a law allowing military force to be used “to suppress international terrorist activity outside the Russian Federation” —  just before the murder of defector Alexander Litvinenko in London. As the FSB’s stature rose, that of its competitors in Russian intelligence was falling. By the late 2000s, the GRU was in disgrace, due to its blunders in Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia, leading to abandoned airfields being bombed and Russian units getting outflanked. Putin also felt the SVR was too conservative and timid for limiting itself to simple  . It had failed to present Washington as being as aggressive as he believed it to be. He was increasingly coming to believe that the United States was leading a campaign to isolate Russia and deny it the   status he felt it deserved. He saw the “Color Revolutions,” for example, as U. S.  plots to topple   governments (Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, and Kyrgyzstan in 2005) and interpreted NATO’s 2011 intervention in Libya as a sign that Washington remained committed to aggressive regime change. The more Putin came to see the West as a threat, the more he felt he needed his spooks both to collect information and to serve as active instruments of his geopolitical ambitions. This perspective seems to have crystallized during his brief time as prime minister and as the power behind the throne, from 2008 to 2012. The FSB scrambled to fill the spook gap left by the flailing GRU and SVR. Suddenly, it was briefing Putin on foreign policy, edging its way into the traditional turf of the SVR and the foreign ministry. It lobbied hard and successfully for the funds and the mandate to mount political operations, first in Europe, then beyond, from funneling resources to populist parties and separatist groups, to penetrating both Democratic and, to a limited extent, Republican National Committee computers. When an indiscreet conversation between Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt emerged in 2014, it was almost certainly both intercepted and then leaked by the FSB. It may even have hijacked SVR and GRU operations: Intelligence insiders told me of FSB reports that claimed credit for information gathered by other agencies. The FSB could do all this because it had Putin’s trust, and because it realized that he increasingly wanted his spies to tell him what he wanted to hear. As one embittered former SVR officer put it to me, “our mistake was to keep talking about the world as it is, not as he would like it to be. ” Thus, the FSB’s political police officers flattered their way into a privileged position, getting tasked with manipulating elections, wooing electorates, and lobbying politicians across the West. These are not just spies under a different acronym, though. Most do not know or respect the etiquette of the shadow war. Their backgrounds as secret police in an authoritarian state make them especially prone to bullying and blackmailing, corrupting and killing. They also operate under far fewer constraints than traditional spies. So long as they remain in Putin’s favor, they can (sometimes literally) get away with murder. Even Russia’s   Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, once able to challenge the spies, is now limited to cleaning up their messes. This has all resulted in a brazen new turn in Russian intelligence operations, with the FSB at the helm. They were behind the   kidnapping of Estonian security officer Eston Kohver in 2014, and, according to sources in Moscow, were behind the DNC leaks, even if the GRU actually collected the emails. They are the ones most eagerly backing and bankrolling divisive extremists and populist leaders in Europe. This is despite the fact that the SVR and GRU have a great deal more experience. But the FSB’s greatest asset is its sheer willingness to take chances. In that respect, it is simply mirroring Putin himself, who has played his weak hand well, precisely by —  at least in the   era —  being more unpredictable and confrontational than anyone else. How will this work out in the long term? When the FSB kidnapped Kohver, it managed to draw attention to the very issue it sought to keep hidden: its own links with organized crime, which subsequently became the focus of more intensive investigation in both Estonia and Europe as a whole. One Italian   officer who had for years been warning about this problem, for example, told me that within a month he had been given the green light to open new investigations into corruption among Russian security officials. Similarly, the agency’s hacking of Western politics looks worryingly effective, but is generating a backlash in the West against Russian interference and disinformation. It has become the story of the moment on both sides of the Atlantic, with the German and French security services warning that Moscow will try to manipulate upcoming elections in both countries. Just as dangerously, the SVR, GRU, and other agencies, have followed the FSB’s lead in tailoring their briefings to flatter Putin’s prejudices and assumptions. As a result, the one man who decides Russian strategy has become cocooned in an   latticework of   dubious interpretations, and ludicrous optimism, which may make him prone to dangerous adventures —  deeper engagement in the Syria quagmire, a wider invasion of Ukraine, or tangling directly with NATO or China. In the long run, the FSB may well be as dangerous to Putin as to the West."
53391,73594,Finding Meaning in Going Nowhere ,Atlantic,Joe Fassler,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"By Heart is a series in which authors share and discuss their   favorite passages in literature. See entries from Karl Ove Knausgaard, Jonathan Franzen, Emma Donoghue, Michael Chabon, and more. A few weeks ago, Ottessa Moshfegh, the author of the new   collection Homesick for Another World, sent me a video of the   singer Lena Zavaroni. I couldn’t believe I’d never heard of her: Zavaroni’s performance of Neil Sedaka’s “Going Nowhere” is so charismatic and emotionally affecting that she seems destined for the brightest fame. Then I read the story of her tragic,   life. A child star with a   voice, people once thought she’d be the next Barbra Streisand. But anorexia, a lifelong struggle that started in her early teens, drew her inward and ultimately away from public life. Zavaroni’s final, most dramatic attempt to save herself was to request experimental brain surgery —  the exact details are unclear. Some accounts suggest the procedure was successful, but we’ll never know: She contracted pneumonia in the process, an infection her starved body couldn’t handle, and she died at 35. In a conversation for this series, Moshfegh explained how the lyrics to “Going Nowhere” recall her own struggles with depression, eating disorders, and ennui. We discussed how writing helped her find purpose and a place, and how the creative process brings her into occasional contact with something even more transcendent: the state of heightened receptivity you glimpse in Zavaroni as she sings, a feeling good enough to guide a life and give it meaning. Opening Paragraphs Don’t Always Have to Be Exciting, The protagonists of Homesick for Another World are alienated outsiders, desperate to find home somehow but not sure how to get there. (Maybe the child narrator of “A Better Place” says it best: “Earth is the wrong place for me, always was and will be until I die. ”) As her characters —  a motley assortment of weirdos and grotesques —  seek solace in romantic infatuation and sexual debasement, Moshfegh’s frightening, funny, and oddly tender portraits explore the ways some people come to love the things that most disgust them. Moshfegh’s first novel, Eileen, was shortlisted for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Man Booker Prize her stories have been featured in The New Yorker, The Paris Review, Granta, and other publications. She spoke to me by phone. Ottessa Moshfegh: I discovered the singer Lena Zavaroni online in 2012. When I saw her performance of “Going Nowhere,” I was completely stunned. The lyrics don’t especially move me, the way they’re written on the page. It’s her performance —  you’re watching a woman who is so clearly struggling to find a reason to live. And her delivery elevates the lyrics somehow, helps you realize the words are just so honest and true. It’s a TV program, probably one of those variety TV shows. The music starts, and then it pans over to her onstage. She’s wearing this     gown, and looks so fragile —  but absolutely  . Like she’s carrying the entire weight of the world inside of her. Her eyes are totally clear. When she’s singing you can see into her mouth, which looks like the mouth of a child. I find that really moving, somehow. She’s not a woman, though she’s certainly not a child anymore. She’s something else. Like an angel of pain. When you’re performing onstage, you can’t see anything. The lights are in your face, and it’s total darkness. So she must not have been able to see the audience —  she belted out this song from the bottom of her heart into the abyss. As the song goes on she gets more and more into it. You can see her working herself up. Not in the Mick Jagger, I’    kind of way. You just get the sense she’s feeling every single word. “Most of you would tell me that I’m crazy, yes I’m crazy   I can’t help it,” she sings, and you believe her. When the song ends, she’s kind of stunned. She blinks as though she’s coming out of a trance. Then people start applauding —  which has always seemed ridiculous to me, to politely applaud this brutal song that grapples with the   meaningless of everything. But she responds so sweetly, and you can tell it makes her feel wonderful —  the way she almost giggles, placing her hand on her heart. I always wonder what happened once she went offstage. Her story just breaks my heart. She was one of those terrible cases of anorexia. There was nothing anyone could do to help her. Eventually, she insisted on having what sounds like a partial lobotomy in an attempt to cure her depression. Also   therapy, and drugs. I don’t think Lena ever had the appreciation from the world that she deserved, because she was so ill mentally and physically, and because she died so young. She was something of a mystery to people. I can’t imagine growing up in the spotlight the way she did. She was discovered in Scotland at a very young age. Wasn’t a beautiful, pretty child or anything —  her incredible spirit and ambition made her stand out, and her phenomenal musical talent. My sense is that her mom was insane in 1989, she burned down the house, destroying all her daughter’s career memorabilia. Reading between the lines, it just seems like —  this is your punishment for leaving me, for trying to have a life of your own. That’s all I can assume. I don’t think an artist gets this complicated and deep unless they’ve been totally betrayed by their family. Her mother committed suicide. In this performance of “Going Nowhere,” I can see that Lena’s singing career probably saved her life and ruined it at the same time. She’s clearly tapping into the divine. She’s possessed by the spirit of the song, and speaking for all of humanity in this moment: And still you try to hold the world together, Make it happen, give it childrenWho in turn are turning onto going nowhere. And all the strength they’d ever need to help themHas been wasted, remains hidden, In the confusion of going nowhere. The absurdity captured in the refrain of the song is something that I have felt in my own writing life a lot. It’s like, what’s the fucking point? Why do we do anything? When I’m depressed, that is the existential depression for me. It’s not like I need to be brilliantly happy all the time, and have everybody telling me I’m wonderful. I don’t need that. But if I’m not going anywhere, why don’t I just be dead? I don’t know what the answer is, except that here’s this gorgeous song that has moved many people. If there is a reason to live, maybe it is just in the relating to one another in this way, and making beautiful art. My nature is not to feel thrilled at being alive. I’m 35 now, but up until my 30s, I really just wanted off the planet. I also have been somebody who felt pretty helpless about my own eating disorder. Nobody came to my rescue, and it was really depressing. I think eating disorders are a way of trying to change who you are because you feel powerless to change the world. It’s a way of turning inward, telling yourself, “Well, this is the one thing that I can control. ” The sad thing is that it ends up controlling you, taking you out of the world. I spent a lot of years in an anorexic and bulimic blackout. I don’t remember what my life was because I was so possessed by this devil. Writing saved my life. It really did. Fiction provided ulterior universes that I could escape into and manipulate. It gave me a semblance of control. Then, there is the great satisfaction of getting something right. Materializing an idea. It’s not unlike music, that feeling: the way that, when you hear a piece of music, your whole body responds. There’s a chemical reaction. Hormones get released. It resonates in you, and you feel moved. When I’ve written something that I know is correct, it resonates in me powerfully. I feel blessed. I’m not one of those writers that sits there scratching my head being like, “What should I write next?” The thing calls to me, and when I get to it, I’m in ecstasy. When I’ve hit the vein, I feel immortal. There’s a lot of pain around it too, but I wouldn’t do it if I weren’t in ecstasy 10 percent of the time. I feel then as though I’ve discovered something, and honored it —  that I’ve made it happen by being a conduit. I have faith in that ability to move beyond myself, and it’s made me strong and  . This is why I believe in God. I usually write in the first person, and when I’m channeling a voice, I really do feel there’s part of me that’s just a conduit. But then there’s also part of me that’s thinking, and manipulating, and pushing. I think about the character I look for resolutions to whatever he’s struggling with. Maybe I won’t take him there, but I do have to understand, at least. In doing that I tend to learn things about myself along the way. Some characters in my work are willing to be changed. Some won’t be. They’ll be shown the door, and they’ll be like, “I don’t like the look of that door. I acknowledge it, but I’m not opening it. ” That’s my life sometimes, too. I can’t take every opportunity for growth —  it’s too exhausting. It’s like the line from this song: “The things that tend to change you, tend to hurt you. ” I relate to that a lot. Growth is painful, especially when there’s nobody to hold your hand. I had to wait until I was an adult before I could figure how to recover from my eating disorder —  it took so long to learn how to take care of myself. It was a lot of work, but I don’t regret it. What do they say —  no pain, no gain? My physical experience in this body has certainly been that way. Change in the body is rarely comfortable. Growing pains, all the   things I’ve done to myself to change what my body is. Recovery is painful. The ego tends towards stasis, and every time it gets hurt it does all these gymnastics to rationalize why it should remain intact and static. That’s in “Going Nowhere,” too, in these lines: And everywhereThey shrug their shoulders, tell themselves that they don’t care, And all the while they make believe they’re happy, oh they’re happy, But not really. That seems like the saddest thing to do. This gesture of telling yourself —  whatever, this isn’t bothering me. I’m going to lie to myself that I’m happy, but I know that I’m not. That’s what people tend to do. We get stuck in our indifference to our own pain. Waking up out of that is excruciating. I just finished the first draft of a new novel in which the protagonist sets out on this project to recover from the trauma of her past by sleeping for a year, attempting hibernation. (She finds out very quickly that this is most easily done using tons of prescription drugs.) It’s a book about putting yourself to sleep in an effort to heal. But it’s also a book about waking up, and what that feels like: intolerable, but also absolutely beautiful. It’s both. Being born, the first thing we do is scream our heads off. Most of the time, I feel pleased that I’m living my purpose on this planet. A lot of my work confronts the devastating concepts in this song. We make art about our own ineffectuality, and in doing that, somehow we are no longer ineffectual. That’s the good news about being a human: We are creative. We feel compelled to make something new, to forge new paths through consciousness and grow. Nobody is going to save me —  that’s how I’ve always felt. It’s up to me. It’s either do or die, and I decided to do. Maybe we’re going nowhere, but I chose to find meaning anyway."

Claims to Power: Senegalese and Nigerian troops are poised to intervene in Gambia as longtime president Yahya Jammeh, who lost a December election, refuses to cede power. Jammeh initially conceded but now says the election was illegitimate. Over in the U. S. some Democrats are arguing the same of Donald Trump, but that might not be saying much: Political opponents have questioned the legitimacy of three successive U. S. presidents, and the biggest effect seems to have been on voters’ trust. In the meantime, Trump has a defender in Vladimir Putin, who claims the  ’s detractors are just trying to discredit him —  but such comments may be a distraction from power grabs by Putin himself. Presidential Passage: Controversies aside, America is continuing its peaceful transition of power, with Barack Obama delivering his last press conference this afternoon. The outgoing president reiterated his faith in American justice and resilience, even as he warned Trump to be careful in making major policy shifts. One of Obama’s last significant acts as president was to commute the sentence of Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning, among hundreds of other prisoners. Though Manning’s commutation has drawn sharp criticism, it’s also part of a broad push for clemency that Obama’s made an effort to build into his legacy. So what’s to come from Trump? Here’s a cheat sheet of his most notable campaign promises we’ll be tracking his progress and updating the list in the coming months. Vaccine Nation: One early act of Trump’s that has   advocates worried is his expected appointment of Robert F. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, to head a commission “on vaccine safety and scientific integrity. ” Though there’s no scientific evidence to back up claims that vaccines are dangerous, there’s already a network of doctors that help patients avoid or delay receiving them, and Kennedy could bring their views more into the mainstream —  with possibly serious consequences for public health. Some optimistic vaccine news: CEPI, a global   fund, launched today with $460 million devoted to creating vaccines to stop outbreaks of the world’s deadliest diseases. Jon Irwin on a demonstration of Nintendo’s latest   console: A father and son stand facing one another, hands at their sides, five feet apart. Each holds a small Nintendo controller in his palm. Right now, that controller is a firearm. Later it will be a samurai sword, a   paddle, or a cow’s udder. The son looks at the large television to his left. “Don’t look at the TV,” a Nintendo employee says. “Look at him,” he says, gesturing to the son’s father. “Look into his eyes. ” The son, about 9 years old, looks up. His father towers over him, but the child’s gaze is steady. Each waits for the game’s single instruction. Dad’s mouth purses. Junior’s arm begins to shudder. The Nintendo employee’s bright red shirt is a looming sunset in the gunslingers’ periphery. Then: “Fire!” The child flings his arm up and hits the trigger button on the controller’s undercarriage. The father, slow on the draw, brings up his arm but knows he’s too late. The TV shows two   cowboys, real people dressed in Western regalia the one on the right falls over, his knees buckling. The son was faster on this day. His dad clutches his chest in mock pain. The son laughs. His eyes are wide open.   …     I didn’t understand why this might be appealing until I tried it myself.

One of the topics on the table was the creation of a League of Nations. In our January 1919 issue, a panel of writers chaired by H. G. Wells made the case for why humans’ technological advances demanded such an organization: All political and social institutions, all matters of human relationship, are dependent upon the means by which mind may react upon mind and life upon life, that is to say upon the intensity, rapidity, and reach of mental and physical communication.   …      And we live   in a time of accelerated inventiveness and innovation, when a decade modifies the material of   far more extensively than did any century before, in range, swiftness, and intensity alike.   …     In education and in the agencies of journalism and propaganda, there has been an increase of power at present incalculable, owing to vast strides in the printing of pictures, and to the cinematograph, the gramophone, and similar means of intense   information and suggestion.   …     While all these things, on the one hand, point plainly now to such possibilities of human unification and world unanimity as no one could have dreamed of a hundred years ago, there has been, on the other hand, a change, an intensification, of the destructive processes of war.   …     What has happened is essentially this, that the natural limitations upon warfare which have existed hitherto appear to have broken down.

What are the most annoying misconceptions about your line of work? From a reader who works in cancer research: Sometimes I’m asked why we haven’t come up with a “cure for cancer. ” This may sometimes come packed with assumptions that the biopharmaceutical industry is deliberately trying to avoid “curing” cancer because there’s so much money in drugs. The reality is, cancer is hundreds of different diseases, and it’s still deeply complex and far from fully understood. So since there’s no clear solution to stopping cancer, therapy is the next best answer, since patients are suffering now. I’m definitely not saying that companies in my industry are doing their absolute best (they’re only as good and smart as the people who run them) but the collective of scientific knowledge says that nothing about this line of research is easy. A recent project that sought to replicate the results of multiple cancer studies underscores that point. Read more from readers on cancer treatment, Big Pharma, and antibiotics in the TAD forum.
